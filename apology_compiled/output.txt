I wish I could take back every apology I ever gave you. I see now that I should never have to apologize for the way I'm feeling, let alone the way you were feeling. I shouldn't take the horrible way you treated me and twist it into being my fault, producing yet another apology to spew from my mouth. 

I thought that every time you were having a bad day, it was my responsibility to fix you. It was my job to talk you from the edge. Each time I lost a little bit of myself in the process.

So this is me saying that if I could take it all back and make you acknowledge your mistakes as your own, I would do it in a heartbeat.

Screw you.life kind of way. It was like you were so used to policing yourself and maintaining a squeaky clean, polite facade that even straying into the most subtle kind of dirty joke or rude language felt a little dangerous (even though every one else does it all the time and much worse). I’m the same way. My language and jokes are so clean that no one really expects me to understand and appreciate the dirty ones (even though I definitely do) and everyone is shocked when I occasionally swear or laugh at what other people say. I just project this image of someone who doesn’t cross that line or only hints at it. But subtly stepping a toe over that line can be fun. 

What makes you a rule-follower? For me, it comes out of a desire for efficiency (following the rules makes things go faster), a little bit of inexperience and naïveté, and a fear of getting called out or yelled at. I have memories of being yelled at or spoken to sternly by adults who weren’t my parents when I was very young and feeling so scared and distressed and embarrassed by it. I guess I started policing my behavior very early on to avoid those experiences. 

Now, when I get into situations where someone might yell at me (especially in my personal life), I either start apologizing and giving in to whatever they want, go completely silent, or try to find a way to escape. 

Is that why you’ve never talked to me directly about any of this? Are you afraid I will yell at you or make it awkward? Or perhaps it isn’t me you fear. Perhaps it is your family? Will you get in trouble if you talk to me? 

One thing I’ve discovered as I’ve struggled through the last few years is, sometimes you have to take the risk of being yelled at. If you don’t, the problems keep festering and growing. Also, some yellers will just keep using your tendency to give in to take advantage and take whatever they want from you. The more you give in, the more they take until they’ve crowded you out of your own decisions, roles, and life. That doesn’t end well for anyone. It’s better to stand up for yourself and push back, especially if you are an equal to the yeller . (Obviously, if it’s your boss,though, they get to overrule you but at least you know they’ve heard and considered your points). 

I hope you know I would never yell at you. I am not a yeller.  Even during uncomfortable conversations, I keep quiet (though I might get nervous or shaky). I also hope you consider talking to me one day. We have so many misunderstandings that need clarification. Also, I’m a pretty great person and you are really missing out by not knowing me ;-).  

And, some day I might have the courage to risk you yelling at me. I might push back on this and plead my case. I’m tired of being meek and this means a lot to me. But, I promise it won’t happen anytime soon. I don’t want to stress you out (and I haven’t the slightest idea how I would even do it). Also, it would be better for everyone if you come to me of your own accord to initiate the conversation. I hope you do someday. 

Until then, I hope you stay well and that things haven’t got you too down. Despite everything,I still worry about your well-being sometimes. I hope you are okay. Take care. does it stop being funny? I'm Eric - who are YOU? \*tips hat\*mes rougher, sometimes clearer, sometimes rockier - but always there. A part of one another. Always.

And, though highly unlikely, maybe we’ll cross paths again one day. But until then, there’s my apology to you. DID pick up smoking again, for now, and for sure the past few months and my experiences have hastened my death - so, well played. If you suspect that my motives are a ruse, that I'm playing the possum, fair enough, and I deserve that. But you're incorrect. If you, or any others, actually ever had my best interest at heart, well, that's hard for me to believe, especially now, but if I'm incorrect too - thanks. Sorry if I fucked that up if it were that way at one point, and changed. I'm trying, truly, and succeeding, slowly but surely. I expect no reprieve, nor will I ask for one. I do offer apologies and forgiveness, and again, my story won't change. If you took the time to read all this, thanks you, whether it makes a bit of difference or not.e a psychopath while letting one whisper bullshit into your ear.

I never lied to you and I never would've. I never wanted anything but happiness for you. I truly cared for you. I loved you. Even after you revealed that you were still married weeks into our relationship. I loved you. Now, however, I see what you are. I pity you. You call me a small man, but even I wouldn't try to publically humiliate someone like you're trying to humiliate me. I trusted you and even if you felt that your trust has been abused, to make a public performance of it is simply immature and pathetic. Especially since you yourself said that internet relationships aren't real in our last conversation, so what's the point again?

I'm not ever heartbroken, since you broke my heart some time ago and it didn't have the time to heal. This was just dull pain. I hope you'll get some satisfaction from this. Just remember, no turning back this time. There's nothing waiting for you here anymore. bit for distancing yourself from me, honestly if I was in your shoes I’d probably do the same. I miss you a lot and I hope you’re doing okay.


Take care of yourself and don’t let anyone, no matter who they are, put you down. You’ve got a super bright future ahead of you, and you’re bound to succeed. Coming from someone as cynical as me, you must be good if someone says that about you. Thanks for the time we spent as friends. 

From,

Your former friends a reality check I’ll always be grateful for.

You stormed off, and I know I watched you leave. I don’t know if I remembered everything immediately or if it took me a few minutes, but I don’t think it would have mattered. Even if I remembered immediately, I doubt I would have chased after you to apologize. I know I remembered shortly after, though, because I only lived like 5 minutes from school and when I got home I had to message you.

For the first time, I apologized to you. You even responded. You even thanked me for the apology and said that it was really all you had wanted since I never did say it before or even acknowledge that what I had done was wrong. You’re really amazing, you know that? I couldn’t have forgiven me. I know I couldn’t have, because I haven’t.

I tried to forgive myself, I really did. I can’t believe that I even had the gall to reach out to you after your freshman year of college. You held a conversation with me and responded thoughtfully when my name didn’t even have the right to pop up as a notification on your phone. That was the last time we talked, and it was over 5 years ago now.

I’ve thought about you a lot since then. About how awful I was, and about how extraordinarily kind you were to me despite it. I can’t forgive myself for it. I won’t let myself feel like I deserve that forgiveness. You gave me forgiveness, but I can’t help but feel like I got off too easily. I didn’t deserve it, and you gave it anyway.

Since that first apology, I’ve thought of apologizing a second time several times. Almost every single time I fall into that vortex and start trying to guess what kind of pain my hate put you through. I’ve even actually written the second apology before, but I didn’t send it. I probably won’t send this one, either, of course. I don’t think I deserve one more moment of your time. I apologized once, and I want to believe that for you that was enough, but it wasn’t enough for me. Because it wasn’t enough for me, it makes me feel like my first one doesn’t count, and that I need to apologize again. I think I could apologize 1000 times and I’d still never be able to forgive myself for it, so I tell myself that you’re strong and that it doesn’t keep you up at night the way it does me. I don’t want you to see my name and be hurt, so it’s better if I let it eat me up inside so that maybe I can hurt you just a little bit less. I noticed you unfriended me on Facebook. I’m not sure when you did it, I’ve barely checked it since graduation anyway, but I found out when I got on one day to go torture myself with my responses to you and saw we weren’t friends anymore. It’s probably the biggest reason I won’t bother you with another apology. Maybe it’s a sign that I should apologize again, but so far I’ve chosen to take it as a sign that that I’m totally cut off, and I certainly won’t be the one to argue that I deserve otherwise.

I hope you’re okay. I think I am.

Even though I can’t forgive myself for it, I’m happy to say that I’ve been able to learn and grow because of it. It’s a reminder to be better. I’m infinitely more empathetic now, and it’s helped me see the worst parts of myself and work on them overtime so that I can reflect on myself and actually be happy with that I see.

I’ve said it once, but I feel like I need to say it again. I’m sorry. I’m so, so sorry. I'm sorry for bullying you, for hurting you more when you were already going through way more than you deserved, for being incapable of understanding how much I had hurt you when you came to me after things had settled down, and for having the audacity to forget all of it even happened until you gave me a much deserved reminder.***I’m sorry to you…***

I’m sorry that my insecurities ruined our relationship.

I’m so sorry that I didn’t understand that, in that moment, you really cared.

I’m sorry that I texted you my feelings instead of saying them face to face.

I’m sorry that we’ll never see each other again.

Most of all, I’m sorry that I caused you any pain.

I know you’ve moved on and I don’t exist for you anymore. I wanted to be better for you but I was too scared you would leave so I drove you away. I’m sorry I did that.

***I’m sorry to myself….***

For not believing it when someone really cares for me.

For not asking for help.

For being unable to accept love.

For ruining the only really real relationship I’ve ever known.

For destroying my own happiness, repeatedly.

I’ve lived a great life and I’ll keep living this one until it’s my time to go. If that time is soon, I’m ok with that. I’m sorry to myself for feeling this way. I didn’t want to.

*I’m sorry that there is no us. I’m sorry that I’ll learn to spend my days laughing with someone else. And I’m really sorry that it’s better this way.* ***I know that I created this. Please accept my apology.***hey, i’m sure i’m the last person you want to hear from, but i acted like a dick to you towards the end of high school and it’s kind of eating at me, so i just wanted to actually apologize. it sucks that i just cut you off with no explanation, and in doing that, i never wanted to alienate you from the rest of our friends, especially not during a rough time for you, and it seems like that’s what happened. i don’t think i’m wrong in saying that in our friendship, we both caused each other a lot of stress, and we weren’t meshing particularly well and hadn’t been for some time. i figured back then that telling you that and explaining myself would make you feel worse, so i just gave you the cold shoulder, but i can see now that that was really childish and probably did a lot more harm than good. i really, really didn’t mean to cut you off from a huge portion of your support system, and i don’t say that to absolve myself of blame because i did it whether i meant to or not, but i’m saying it to let you know that i don’t hold that much malice towards you, you aren’t and never have been hated by me, and i wouldn’t have let that happen if i hadn’t been so shortsighted and selfish. i was going through a difficult time, yes, but you were going through a more difficult time. i respect you for your strength and drive, and i’ve had enough dreams lately where i’m apologizing to you that i just felt like i should finally actually stop being a coward and do it. you probably still think i’m a bitch, and that’s fine, i was a bitch to you. i don’t need you to respond to this or acknowledge it if you don’t want to, i just needed to say it.You didnt reply. I figure it's one of two things: you have me blocked, or you saw it and decided not to reply. I hope it's the latter because I need you to know I'm sorry for the things I said. I didnt mean them. And if we never talk again I need you to know that... well. I loved you and I always will.

I mean, I am glad you didnt reply. My heart may have given up the ghost if you had. Theres nothing you could say at this point that I'd be happy hearing, and nothing I could say to make you take back what you did. I'm glad we are out of each other's life but... I am sorry. I think I stand by my reaction but I should have said it a different way. I was angry. I was emotional.

I'm sorry. I hope you're somewhere happy.Dear M,

This is not really a letter I want to write because these are literally the last things I have to tell you. And after this... I don't know what excuse I could come up with to talk to you in my head. I guess I need to hit that wall though.

I'm sorry that I got upset over completely asinine stuff that didn't matter whatsoever. I'm sorry that I was pissy over you wanting to put a bed cover on the mattress. I'm sorry that I was resistant to having an additional sheet on the bed. I'm sorry that I wouldn't buy you a lamp for the living room when the living room was fucking dark and you had legitimate night vision issues. I'm sorry that I still put up a hissy fit when you bought one for yourself to use. And I'm sorry that I would freak the fuck out when you would leave the light on. I'm sorry that I would freak the fuck out when you'd leave any electronic device even plugged in after you were done using it. I'm sorry that I always put my comfort first. I'm sorry that we didn't cuddle at night. I'm sorry that I would control the house temperature. I'm sorry that I tried to make you feel bad about liking yarn and knitted clothing just because I didn't like touching it. I'm sorry that I tried to narrow your social supports outside of me. I'm sorry I thought Dungeons & Dragons was completely stupid. I'm sorry that I also tried to get you to stop going to those DnD meetings. I'm sorry that I didn't want to socialize with your family. I'm sorry that I got upset when you would discuss our issues with other people. I'm sorry that I treated inconveniences to me as more important than your legitimate concerns. I'm sorry that I was deeply annoyed that you requested we use separate cookware because you have celiac's disease, and I regularly cooked pasta. I'm sorry that I wanted to intrude on any time that you took for yourself. I'm sorry that I would request insistently to take showers with you and would become deeply depressed when you turned me down. I'm sorry that I would prod the limits of your boundaries. I'm sorry that I was an ass. I'm sorry that I made you feel bad for being startled. I'm sorry that I took pleasure in startling you. I'm sorry that I teased you incessantly. I'm sorry that I teased you about not knowing directions. I'm sorry that I teased you about forgetting things. I'm sorry that I continued to tease you about things you explicitly asked me not to tease you about. I'm sorry that I pressured you to have sex when you were not in the mood. I'm sorry that I would pressure you to eat meat when you were a vegetarian. I'm sorry that I routinely went to restaurants that didn't cater to your diet at all. I'm sorry that I roped your mom in to pressuring you to eat fish. I'm sorry that I took every chance I could to praise how good meat is, especially bacon. I'm sorry that I dehumanized animals in front of you. I'm sorry that I wasn't supportive of changes you wanted to make to yourself. I'm sorry that I didn't want you to wear make-up. I'm sorry that we didn't end up holding hands more frequently after you mentioned you thought we should. I'm sorry that I dismissed things you wanted to share with me. I'm sorry that I didn't get the hint that Pinterest would have been way for you to tell me what you wanted to do, what you would enjoy, and what you would like to receive as gifts. I'm sorry that I didn't celebrate your accomplishments. I'm sorry that I didn't take your anxiety seriously. I'm sorry that I insisted you drive in large cities when I knew it caused you anxiety. I'm sorry I had you drive in the snow. I'm sorry I had you drive at night. I'm sorry I would play the music too loud in the car and would become pissed off when you asked me to turn it down. I'm sorry that my impulsiveness put my priorities in the wrong order. I'm sorry that I drove your car at stupidly high speeds on the interstate while you were sleeping in the back seat. I'm sorry that I would rather spend money on pointless crap when I could have bought a car to drive out to see you. I'm sorry that I pressured you to buy things that you didn't want to buy. I'm sorry that I was always either too little or too much. I'm sorry that I would freak out to you about what complete strangers did in public. I'm sorry that I would give you the silent treatment when I was angry or frustrated. I'm sorry that I thought it would be acceptable to buy another girl that you were already jealous of a set of pillowcases for Christmas. I'm sorry that I left you responsible for paying the rest of the rent in our old apartment. I'm sorry that I thought I was being a reasonable person the entire time. I'm sorry for several more things that wouldn't pass a PG-13 rating.

But most of all... I'm sorry that there were good times in between all that bullshit. I didn't think of it like this at the time. But a lot of that bullshit was legitimate emotional abuse. And I didn't do this purposefully, but spreading positive things in between emotional abuse reinforces an abused person to stay where they are. And that's what I was doing for years, whether I meant it or not. I'm sorry.

I had always thought that if I had met the past me in some way that me and him would get along. I'd think he would have some things to learn, but he would learn them in time because he was smart. I would have given him a hug because some tough times are ahead. But now... now I would tell people to stay away from him and force him to get help. And I would stay with him until he got better. He wasn't ever going to hurt anyone physically, but he was hurting other people. And he was ruining everything for himself.

I'm sorry that I sent you a physical letter. It turns out that that was just another form of emotional abuse that I wasn't aware of. I thought I knew what was going on in my head when I sent it. But apparently there's more than that. I'm beginning to realize that remission of my personality disorder may be more difficult to achieve than I had anticipated. And now I know that I might not know everything... As recently as last week, I still hoped that I would hear from you at some point. But this is a delusion. I won't hear from you ever again.

I can't express how much I value you. And that sounds like such a sick thing to say when I look back on how I treated you. But since you left, I've had a mental copy of you in the back of my head. I know it isn't you as you are now. But she's still there telling me to calm down, telling me to listen to other people, telling me to be understanding, telling me to be empathetic, telling me to care, telling me to help others when I can, telling me to stop being so full of myself, telling me to work on myself. And she's still drawing layouts on tables with her fingers to start a story.

I wish I knew myself. It's really fucking weird having BPD and possibly NPD, having the self-awareness that many of my thoughts, emotions, and actions have roots in personality disorders, knowing what is that I'm supposed to be working towards, but never being sure if what I do is what a healthy person would do. Everything is like dialed to 11 in my head, but I have to dial it back to like a 4, 5, or 6 to be healthy. But just about the only thing I know that I can do with certainty is dial it back to 0. And I can't differentiate the numbers 1-11. And all the while I find the whole damn thing simultaneously entertaining and depressing. It's so fucking weird.

Take care of yourself. And I hope you stay away from people that have been like me.

Goodbye,I apologize. 
I apologize for making you a priority.
I can see now from your behavior that was never something you wanted from me. 
I apologize for giving you space in my heart and thoughts.
You do not want to occupy them, much as you like to push me to background. 
I apologize for including you in my life.
You have shown me there is no place for me in yours. 
I apologize for putting my trust in you. 
It never mattered to you.
Mostly, I apologize for letting you hurt and disrespect me.Heya,

I’m sorry I didn’t recognize how important you are to me until just recently. I’d like to blame the fact that I’ve been wildly unstable for... well my whole life I guess, but I hate when people blame their mistakes on anything other than themselves. So I won’t do that. You have been the most impactful person in my life. You make me think. You take me as I am. Even at my worst I was able to hold myself up enough so that the burden of me wasn’t put entirely on your shoulders, but that doesn’t mean the load wasn’t great. You handled it like a champ. Thank you. After years and years of effort, I’ve finally found my solution. I’m trying so hard to make sure that never happens again, but I can’t promise that. I don’t know if I can ever give you, or anyone else, peace. Maybe that’s not my responsibility. It feels like it should be though. 

Some of this realization is only intellectual though. It hasn’t hit emotionally yet. I’m sorry for that too. Others are still making me feel lonely, but I shouldn’t feel lonely knowing you’re in my corner, right? It’s so hard for me to tell. I don’t think I ever really learned how to feel things like a normal person and even with these meds I’ll never be normal. I don’t think that’s a bad thing. I just don’t know how normal friendships are supposed to work. 

The third part is quiet. Even if you’re listening for it you might not hear it. That’s because it’s mine. The closer you get the more you’re able to hear. It’s soft strings with heavy keys. It’s the deep thrum of my bass. It’s my low, slightly off key voice. But this isn’t a song for me to share. I’m sorry for loving you. Wholly and unconditionally. I know this happens to you too often. Guys get close under the pretense of just being friends and then get angry with you when you don’t reciprocate their feelings. I’m glad that you’ve been able to sort them out, stand your ground, and speak your truth, but I know it hurts too. That isn’t what happened with us. This is an accident. Something I didn’t see coming, but I should have. Maybe I could have addressed it differently and avoided this. In any case, I won’t be them. I’ll be with you like this for as long as you’ll have me. I’ll take care of myself in the meantime and work on filling that part of my life outside of our relationship. 

Even now, in a letter about you, I’m talking about myself too much. I’ve been too introspective for too long, but I’m finally in a place where I can direct my energy outward. I guess there’s a fourth apology there too.

To our adventures in life, in books, and through music.for liking the things that you do. Who cares if that track is "too angsty," that tv show "too nerdy," that hobby "too weird?" 

Who cares if I like it too or not? 
You're my friend, and it makes you smile. I love that. 

You. Are. Lovely.I don't know if there is a time or a place I will ever see you again. Somewhere I could tell you the truth, the whole story. About me, about what happened.


Maybe it's too late. The realization of this has been like a slow, sinking feeling. Warm, almost welcoming. 


It's sad. I'm sad.


... 


... So, the truth. If I can even manage it anymore.


I'm a lonely person. Always have been. I realize that now, and for what it's worth, I accept it. Like slowly slipping into a body of water, I convinced myself that I would always be alone, and, like becoming fully submerged, my dreams of a companion in this life were, too.


Until I saw you. 


Somewhere, deep down in my soul. All my hopes and dreams, reflected in your eyes. These feelings, I didn't know what do with them. I struggled to understand what it meant. Like a long lost childhood friend, you felt familiar, yet at the same time so far away.


...


... And as soon as I could even realize, you were gone. Only an image remained, your eyes haunting me, still. Life went on. 


Until one day. One fateful day. I saw you again. Older this time. Like me. Your eyes, deeper than before, but still very much the same azure depths that had haunted me for so long. Speaking in a language only I could understand. 


I confessed. I confessed my feelings. As best as one could, I did. At least I thought I had. You told me you weren't the type of person for a relationship. Those words. The very same I'd told myself, once again felt like slipping into that all familiar sinking feeling, only deeper now. 


Ever since that day, my life became a living nightmare. Every day, a struggle for survival. Every night, dreams of longing and betrayal. 


On the foreshore, the light from whence you came only seemed to fade deeper into the night with every passing day. Like a hopeless romantic in love with an afterimage. Only, I was no Gatsby, and you were certainly no Daisy. 


I destroyed my life gazing into those lights. Neglecting all but dreams of you. Waking up with my face in a ditch somewhere. Sinking deeper into the great bath of my own fractured mind.


... So, the truth. 


I'm sick. 


"Schizophrenia", the words still ringing in my ears. 


Does it make a difference? Could I have done something differently? Was there ever a reality we both occupied? My actions, were they mine? Or were they simply the chattering of a deranged mind? 


All I know is, I can never separate myself from them. Just like I can never separate myself from you in my dreams.


I once said to you that what I've done to you is my own greatest fear. I don't think you understood what I meant, and, to be frank, neither did I. Now, I do. 


The truth is, I still love you. 


And for that, I am eternally sorry. 



V.I’m sorry for falling harder than I thought I would. I’m not supposed to love you.

I’ve never felt so drawn to someone before. When I look at you my heart sinks so far. Knowing that you aren’t the one. 

I’m sorry for loving you so hard.I'm sorry I ever attempted to maintain a friendship with you.

What a waste of time that was.Is it? It it that easy? 

...You know, honestly? I don't think there's a way to deal with it. I made *so many* mistakes during that time period that eventually it's probably better to dump a liter of gasoline on it, light a match and call it a day. Mistakes, mind you, that I haven't even fully addressed to you. And when the situation is so far removed at this point, why even apologize? To alleve my own guilt? If the situation shows up at my doorstep and forces an answer out of me, I know what I'd like to say. Anything else though, is me just bringing up a couple-years old drama for the sake of spicing things up. And honestly, *I'm* the one that blocked *you*. Because EVEN when you seemed to forgive me, I couldn't take myself seriously. 

And don't you worry one bit - while it maybe not even take up an iota of memory to you, it still haunts me. Too many inconsistencies, too many mistakes by my part, only prolonged by a sprinkle of unfortunate coincidence. There's no hope in "letting go", there's no hope in the guilt subsiding. It's something to suffer by my own mind for as long as I go. I'm just not the kind of person to ever let go of this kind of thing.

I mean, if you want to hear it, then I'm sorry. I'm sorry a thousand times over. I have changed the systematic way I've approached people in similar situations to when I've found you. I have changed the ways I view those acts, and I'm ashamed for what I have said. I wish you knew what my feelings are, but I fear I will just open the wound again - and to be honest with you, I would STILL block you afterwards for my personal sanity.

It's strange, because despite all the awful experiences I have dealt with before and after you, my personal depression, my idealization of suicide, you were the one situation that I have felt the most remorse for. It's easy to understand why. It was the first real situation I had total control over, and I fucked it up beyond belief. 

It ironically is an apology you'll never hear, and it's the truest I can provide - by assuring that when in that situation, I can provide healthy advice without overstepping. Personally, I think I've mostly succeeded with the people thereafter, but really, the mistake I made with you taught me all of that. 

I am truly, from the bottom of my heart, sorry for what I said to you that night. I genuinely hope you're happy now.1.I am sorry I left.  I completely and utterly abandoned you.  I am sorry for doing that.
2.  I am sorry I found love and passion with another man and that caused me to withdraw from needing you.  
3. I am sorry if anything I did caused you to question your virility or sexuality or abilities or sexiness.  You were and I suspect, still are, a very attractive and appealing man.
4.  I am sorry that I have bpd and my mental health impacted you the way it did.  All I can say is that I was undiagnosed before and had  no understanding that I was manic or extremely moody due to a mental health condition at the time.
5.  I am sorry that sometimes, in anger, I spoke about you (anonymously) to others.  I sometimes described you in not so flattering terms- and what I experienced in trying to be friends with you- in not so objective ways.  I vilified you and I know that is something that bugged you.  
6.  Most of all- I am sorry that I caught feelings for you.  I tried hard not to and thought I would be okay because you and I were not each other's types IRL.  But you took me by surprise and before I knew it- I cared way too much about you.  I am sorry if that made you feel scared, trapped or anything.  I tried hard to stifle my feelings but sometimes it got hard when you were gentle or kind or loving towards me.  I did genuinely, and still do, care about you as a person and want you to be safe, happy and healthy.

It really sucks I can't tell you all these things in person.  I have an old email and a old cell phone number.  But barring the end of the world (and even then maybe not) I won't intrude on whatever peace and quiet you enjoy in your life now because I am not a part of it ...anymore.

I’m sorry that anytime I try to have a discussion about serious social issues that will have ramifications on my sons future, you turn it into a bashing fest on my personality. Im sorry you just wish I could be happier. I’m sorry I’m not and don’t meet your expectations of a strong person.

sorry you think I blame you. I’m sorry that I destroyed every relationship with anyone who decided to blame you.Hey Ashley,

I hope you’re doing okay.

I don’t have a right to think about you, but sometimes I can’t help it. I have a lot of regrets as a result of things I have said or done in the past that I can’t stand. They don’t always eat away at me, but whenever I trap myself in my headspace, I inevitably start going over past mistakes and thoughts. I’ll linger on those thoughts, some of them from so many years ago. I go over countless hypothetical scenarios to think about what I could have done to be better. Of course, that just makes me feel even more like I should have made the right choice back then. All of these nasty thoughts act as a vortex where the bad feelings are perpetual and happiness is incapable of breaking through the barrier. Sometimes I’ll sit in the quiet thinking about those thoughts for hours at a time, and sometimes that means those thoughts leave me alone for a little while longer, but other times the next day comes and those thoughts come back, sucking me under the surface and threatening to drown me in the never-ending torture that is my own head. And then it happens again the next day, and maybe even the next, until eventually I find my way back to the surface where I can gasp for breath.

Comparatively, I’ve done worse things to others, and I always think about them, too. But for some reason, it feels like you’re the one I think about the most. The one I think about first. The one that I wish most of all I could go back and change.

Do you remember when we first really met? A lot of my memories are blurry, which might be part of why I try to relive the parts I can remember so much, even if it hurts. The first thing I can remember is us sharing some dumb computer class freshman year. Did we sit next to each other, or just close by? I’ve always been really insecure, especially when it came to girls, but we talked and became friends and eventually I started to have a crush on you. I don’t remember who asked who, but I remember that we dated for a short time. I think it lasted like a week, and even then it’s hard to look back and call it dating. We only really saw each other at school, and even though we were supposed to be together, I was too awkward to even hold your hand or kiss you because somehow I felt like it was still fake or you didn’t want it, and I definitely couldn’t find my voice to actually ask. I don’t remember who it was, but one day when we were saying bye to each other after school, a friend of yours had asked if we were going to at least hug. I’m sure I was an awkward mess, and in hindsight you probably weren’t much better.

The “relationship” only lasted like a week, but I remember that you were the one that broke up with me. I remember that you were born Christian, and for some reason I feel like I remember you citing the fact that I wasn’t as a reason for you ending things. I’ve never actually thought about the reasons for it, but now I can’t help but think if there was something else, too. I know I was insecure, but maybe you were, too. Maybe you felt like I was leading you on or something since I didn’t seem to actually want to do anything that even a high school couple would do. No point in lingering on the thoughts, I guess.

I don’t remember us talking a whole lot after that. We had mutual friends still, and I’m sure we shared idle chit-chat from time to time, but our friendship effectively ended. The next thing I remember about us is when two girls that were supposed to be your friends were cyber bullying you one night the summer before junior year. I was messaging them, too, but I don’t know if I ever even bothered to ask why they thought you deserved that kind of hate. Maybe they told me, and my twisted fucking head said it made sense. There’s no excuse or justification for it, but I chose to join in. I said hateful things to you, hateful things that I can’t even remember anymore. I only vaguely feel like it had something to do with you and your Christian beliefs, which was probably the best way I could think of to hurt you. You never deserved any of that, not from them and certainly not from some asshole who wasn’t even a part of whatever had brought it all about. When people call others monsters, it’s usually due to some heinous crime, but that one night of bullying is more than enough for me to call myself a monster.

I’ve gone back to look at our Facebook messages from all those years ago. You confronted me about my behavior, maybe the next day or a few days later, I have no idea. I was unapologetic. You said you didn’t understand why I said things, and my excuse was that I was just getting on the bandwagon. You told me what I said hurt, and I had the fucking audacity to say the truth hurts. As if that wasn’t enough, I tried to tell you that you let people get to you too easily. Like, what the actual fuck? It’s bad enough that I thought it was okay to bully you in the first place, but when given a chance to apologize even in private, I thought the correct response was to fucking *double down*? Every time I think about it I start shaking in anger. How could anyone possibly lack such a basic understanding of empathy?

That was probably the last time we talked for a long time. I know — I *knew* — how bullying and feelings can affect people. I struggled with my own problems regarding that, so I knew what kind of damage words could do. I forgot about what happened that night, and I even forgot about me doubling down, but I know you didn’t. I can’t imagine how much it hurt, and I can’t help but wonder if you shook with rage when you saw me in the halls.

A little over a year later, we had started senior year. I was following around a friend that was giving me a ride home at the end of the school day, and you two had lockers just a few feet from each other. I don’t remember talking to you much over the year before, but maybe I did and you just bottled up your response anytime I thought I deserved to speak to you. That day, though, we exchanged words. I said something, something I no longer remember, and you responded in a way that I obviously took offense to, because I brushed you off as just acting like a bitch. You responded by telling me that I was the one that gave you a reason to be a bitch. Thank you for that. That was a reality check I’ll always be grateful for.

You stormed off, and I know I watched you leave. I don’t know if I remembered everything immediately or if it took me a few minutes, but I don’t think it would have mattered. Even if I remembered immediately, I doubt I would have chased after you to apologize. I know I remembered shortly after, though, because I only lived like 5 minutes from school and when I got home I had to message you.

For the first time, I apologized to you. You even responded. You even thanked me for the apology and said that it was really all you had wanted since I never did say it before or even acknowledge that what I had done was wrong. You’re really amazing, you know that? I couldn’t have forgiven me. I know I couldn’t have, because I haven’t.

I tried to forgive myself, I really did. I can’t believe that I even had the gall to reach out to you after your freshman year of college. You held a conversation with me and responded thoughtfully when my name didn’t even have the right to pop up as a notification on your phone. That was the last time we talked, and it was over 5 years ago now.

I’ve thought about you a lot since then. About how awful I was, and about how extraordinarily kind you were to me despite it. I can’t forgive myself for it. I won’t let myself feel like I deserve that forgiveness. You gave me forgiveness, but I can’t help but feel like I got off too easily. I didn’t deserve it, and you gave it anyway.

Since that first apology, I’ve thought of apologizing a second time several times. Almost every single time I fall into that vortex and start trying to guess what kind of pain my hate put you through. I’ve even actually written the second apology before, but I didn’t send it. I probably won’t send this one, either, of course. I don’t think I deserve one more moment of your time. I apologized once, and I want to believe that for you that was enough, but it wasn’t enough for me. Because it wasn’t enough for me, it makes me feel like my first one doesn’t count, and that I need to apologize again. I think I could apologize 1000 times and I’d still never be able to forgive myself for it, so I tell myself that you’re strong and that it doesn’t keep you up at night the way it does me. I don’t want you to see my name and be hurt, so it’s better if I let it eat me up inside so that maybe I can hurt you just a little bit less. I noticed you unfriended me on Facebook. I’m not sure when you did it, I’ve barely checked it since graduation anyway, but I found out when I got on one day to go torture myself with my responses to you and saw we weren’t friends anymore. It’s probably the biggest reason I won’t bother you with another apology. Maybe it’s a sign that I should apologize again, but so far I’ve chosen to take it as a sign that that I’m totally cut off, and I certainly won’t be the one to argue that I deserve otherwise.

I hope you’re okay. I think I am.

Even though I can’t forgive myself for it, I’m happy to say that I’ve been able to learn and grow because of it. It’s a reminder to be better. I’m infinitely more empathetic now, and it’s helped me see the worst parts of myself and work on them overtime so that I can reflect on myself and actually be happy with that I see.

I’ve said it once, but I feel like I need to say it again. I’m sorry. I’m so, so sorry. I'm sorry for bullying you, for hurting you more when you were already going through way more than you deserved, for being incapable of understanding how much I had hurt you when you came to me after things had settled down, and for having the audacity to forget all of it even happened until you gave me a much deserved reminder.For doing what he did with your phone that night. Getting my nudes on your phone and you waking up to that. What makes you think I’m okay with this either.. I’m not a never have been. Yes I liked you but I wasn’t even talking to you. I was talking to your friend. A stranger.. so honestly I know you think I’m fucking gross I get it.. I am sorry for whatever the fuck I did that “hurt” you so bad. You are a hurting unit dude. Admit it. I’m not a fucking creep or rapist. You should have a conversation with a counsellor.

Hey friend,

How have you been doing recently? Eh, that’s a dumb question, us British people haven’t handled the pandemic well so presumably you’re as bored and pissed off as the rest of the country. I know I am. But I digress.


I remember when we first became friends at our drama group, that I had been having a rough time at school thanks to people bullying me over the fact that I’m dyspraxic and autistic and my cat being on the verge of death (and later passing away like 4 weeks later), and how quickly we formed a bond, and how you were genuinely kind and funny and caring and understanding. I’d never really met anyone that nice before, especially since you didn’t have any reason to be that way to me, you just were and I think if it weren’t for you I probably would have just given up acting altogether eventually. You had a lot of good advice for problems and whenever you noticed I was down I’d always get a hug, and I hope I was able to help in a similar way. I’ve not necessarily had problems with making friends in my life per se, but you were the first person I think I really valued as a friend beyond “oh there’s someone who might talk about Pokémon with me or something fun”. You also helped me both directly and inadvertently become a much nicer and more socially outgoing person to my older friends and helped me make newer friends so I’ll always be grateful for that. It was also great getting to end the year with the pantomime I’d written for the group and getting to see you show off your talent in one of the lead roles, and how supportive you were when I wrote it.

About half a year after we hit it off I noticed something...different about you. As you probably member when we first became friends whenever we weren’t making each other laugh we used to spend a fair amount of time telling each other about our mutual problems and yours weren’t particularly easy problems, but you seemed relatively on top of them. However, your personality itself seemed different and you seemed somewhat more on edge and you had more of a sadness about you. I initially just dismissed it as you “just having a couple of bad weeks” but as the problems grew I got concerned, so I took the opportunity to talk to a teacher at my school on a mental health day about your problems and they basically told me very firmly that I “needed to keep an eye on you”, which wasn’t the most inspirational or useful advice, but it gave me a purpose and something I told myself I would do, because I felt obligated to help in any way I could. It turns out for a combination of reasons such as autism and the fact that we only see each other once a week that I’m not always the best at “helping”, but I tried. If I noticed you were sad I tried my best to help you out, either by making subtle attempts at making you laugh or just asking if you were alright, which thanks to my autism didn’t always work, as I wasn’t exactly the most eloquent speaker in awkward situations and I had a habit of saying clumsy and downright stupid things that probably did more harm than good, and one particular incident led to me annoying you enough for you to get annoyed and even make me cry a little. I understand you never meant to do that though so I forgive you for that and I’m sorry for being absolutely terrible at trying to help you out.

After a few months you told me what had been bothering you during this time period and I was shocked at what I heard and I took it upon myself to help you recover in any way I could, and in a rare moment of success I think I genuinely helped. It was great seeing you smile again, but unfortunately it went into my autistic head a bit too much, which is where some of the real problems began. Oh boy. 

Another half a year or so passes and you seem a bit more down again, and a bit more distant. I told myself I wasn’t going to let you get hurt again, no matter what that would take, not knowing that I was way over my head in thinking I could singlehandedly cure your sadness with my magic powers. I was a stupid, clumsy, child trying his best to play the hero and I didn’t consider that you didn’t always need me around and I’m sorry for not realising that perhaps you didn’t need my help and for being pushy about it all. I was just worried.

Now for the worst part and the part I wish didn’t happen most of all, to the point where if I was told I could time travel to one point in my life to prevent something from happening it would probably be this. I’m sorry for losing my patience with you near Christmas time. I was stressed, I was tired and I stupidly misinterpreted something you’d said to me into something worse and I just kind of broke, for lack of a better word. You were right to call me out on my bullshit and tell me how terrible that I was being, you saw through it all and I know that I effectively stopped being your friend there and then, and I deserved to be shown the errors I’d made.  


After that particular incident I selfishly spent the last few weeks or so decrying 2019 as the “worst year ever” (haha I know) whenever anyone would discuss the events of the year with me, and while we’ve since been more civil towards one another when interacting and I’ve tried a little to make it up to you I can tell I messed up and that you’re still rightfully somewhat bitter (you’re only human) and thanks to the pandemic I don’t think I’ll ever get the chance to a) properly make it up to you and earn your forgiveness properly and b) say goodbye because I have to cut ties with the drama academy and become an adult. I’d love to be your friend again and if you asked for me to hang out or talk again I’d accept in a heartbeat but I have only myself to blame for fucking it up and er, yeah, I guess that’s the end of all that, and I don’t blame you one bit for distancing yourself from me, honestly if I was in your shoes I’d probably do the same. I miss you a lot and I hope you’re doing okay.


Take care of yourself and don’t let anyone, no matter who they are, put you down. You’ve got a super bright future ahead of you, and you’re bound to succeed. Coming from someone as cynical as me, you must be good if someone says that about you. Thanks for the time we spent as friends. 

From,

Your former friendIve kicked myself for every feeling of butterflies in my tummy and every glance that lingered just a little bit too long.
Ive beaten myself time and time again because I missed the point in the moment.

Honestly, I loved every second we spent together, my heart still soars when I see your smile. But I'm sorry I felt undeserving of your affection. My own humility, and my own lack of self worth drove me to refuse your attention, and I withdrew more because of it.

So i'm sorry.
I'm sorry I spent more evergy suffocating myself in doubt than smothering you with kisses.
I'm sorry for every time I wanted to reach for your hand and didn't.
I'm sorry for not telling you how I felt.
I'm sorry for refusing to acknowledge the possibility that I i'm not as unlovable as I believe myself to be.
Most of all, i'm sorry for not realizing that you may have felt the same way...

I love my fiancée, and I would never leave her side for the world... but I want nothing less than the best for you too.

In the of case you finding this before finding me again, know that I would love to be your best friend and confidant.
I still long to see your smile light up the room, and know that you are happy.

I hope you find your slice of happiness in someone that loves, cares for, and respects you as i have.

With all the love I wish i could have shown you.
-The ginger bearded fuck you used to hang out with.Thank you for everything you said to me when you apologized. I’ve read the letter 7 times, knowing I can never respond. 

I had a dream about you last night. It had only been nightmares, for so so long. 

You were so quiet and you just let me hold you and cry and touch your face. I remembered how you smelled and what your hugs felt like. I touched your stubble and held your face. I still can never forgive you. But I accept your apology. I really hope you get better. 

It feels like I finally found my peace.But instead, I broke your heart.

Now, I sit here, and I think about you and how much I miss you and how much I wish things had been different.

We could have had a beautiful life together. We could have made each other happy and we could have loved each other, deeply. We could have had a lovely family with the sweetest children in the world. We could have chased the stars together, laughed together, cried together, danced together...

Yet now, I sit here, and I think about how I failed you. How you’ll never be able to trust me again and worse, how I’ll never be able to trust myself. I took everything we had - everything we could have had - and threw it away. Buried it deep into the layers of hopes and dreams now lost, a pool of memories that we almost had, could have had, but didn’t. 

And those memories that we did have, well, they’ll tear me apart. They’ll tear you apart too, I know. Everywhere I look I see things that remind me of you. They remind me of everything I loved about you. Everything that I lost when I shattered your trust. And I regret it so much. I can’t even express how much I regret what I did. But I can’t take it back. I just can’t.

All I can do is sit here, wishing I could’ve learned to love you better. I almost did. I almost did, until I didn’t. I didn’t love you when it counted most. Instead, I betrayed you. I broke your heart. I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry I lost everything. Everything we had. Everything we could have had.I’m sorry that I put you in this situation. 

I’m sorry that I ruined a good friendship by overstepping my boundaries. 

I’m sorry that I continued to pursue you despite your requests to stay away. 

I’m sorry that I didn’t give you the space you needed to heal. 

I’m sorry that I projected my own fears onto you. 

I’m sorry for letting this all go out of control without dealing with things better as they were bothering me. 

I’m sorry for not communicating with you better. 

I’m sorry for putting you in awkward situations with the community. 

I’m sorry for not recognizing your intentions to help before things got worse.  

I’m sorry for burdening you with my mental health issues. 

I’m sorry for wrongly assuming I knew what your feelings and thoughts were without talking to you first. 

I’m sorry for not apologizing sooner. 

I’m sorry for being too much of a coward to be able to send this to you. 

I’m sorry for putting you through this all. 

I’m sorry.I am sorry after loving you for over 25 years I let you down. We have always loved each other since we met when you was 11 and I was 13. I was crazy for you. You were my first love. The first girl i took out on a date, my first kiss, and the first girl to ever touch me. We never broke up I always got moved around. So we never grew to hate eachother and everytime we were reunited we were right back to were we left off. I left you this last time for a long time. I joined the Army and looked for you for years and eventually ended my search for now. After all the nightmares that a 3 tours to Iraq could bring and one nasty marriage all i wanted was to come home and find you. I called so many times and left messages with your parents to please call me. All i wanted was to come home and hold you and smell your hair. This time it was you that was moving on and gotten married and had a kid of your own. It broke my heart but I was so happy you found a man that made you happy. That day when your sister messaged me and told me she couldnt wait to tell you, was one of the best days of my life. I knew what was coming. And now here we are. We have made it through so many storms but I am still just as much as in love with you as I have ever been, even more to see how forgiving you are. But never again do I want to see that pain in your eyes. I dont know why I cheated on you. There is no excuse. I have been in so much pain that i hold in, i dont know why. Im not going to spell it all out but we know I have been through so much, and thats what also kills me. I know you have been through the worst of it as well, and the fact i hide behind that makes me feel like even less of a man. You are the strongest women I know, and I wish i had enough strength in me to look you in the eyes without crying and tell you this myself. I love my beautiful, free, always ready fly Jay Bird.Please don't say how unwelcome this message may be.. I didn't want to say anything to you (for a while at least, I get that we live different lives and I know now more than ever how important that is).

Basically, I found a load of old messages I sent you, like from a year ago when I was angry at the world and really angry at you. I had this massive plan for us and couldn't accept that you wanted something else, and most importantly I couldn't accept that you were happy, that you were so freaking happy with how life had turned out for you. I hated you for it because I was extremely selfish and downright disgusting.

I hate that all. I feel sick reading back what I sent to you, and I just wanted to let you know how deeply sorry I am for ever talking to you like that. It was narcissistic, it was gaslighting, it was semi-abusive. No one should ever talk to you like that, and I'm so sorry that I ever did. I hope no one else has or ever will. I sincerely hope I didn't knock your confidence whilst you've been having the time of your life. And I hope you're still living your absolute best life with people who wouldn't dream of talking to you like that. No one deserves that, but especially not you.

There are so many things I've wanted to apologise for, but I've tried to keep the space between us (I know I've not been the best at that though, guess it just shows how friendly and fab you are aha). But when I found these messages I just knew I had to say something, because holy shit I don't know how you continued to be friendly with me after that.

You're one of a kind, thankyou for letting me me part of your life while you did, and I hope we cross paths one day in the future for just a while to catch up.

Stay wavey bro 
(cause.. waves.. on the lake...)I’m sorry I couldn’t be what you wanted me to be at that time. 

You wanted the attention that I didn’t want from you. I shouldn’t have delved deeper. It’s only left me more empty than when it first started. 

I can’t go any further. Not if I’m being shown that things won’t just go back to way they were before. 

I need you. I love you more than anything in this world. I want you. I want to be everything you want me to be. I want to spend my life with you. 

But I can’t go any further until I believe you want the same.I am sorry.

My behaviour was appalling and abhorrent. 
You deserved, and still deseve far better than that. You were batting well below your average just by taking pity on me. You were the kindest and sweetest person I had met. I repaid that by misreading you, overreacting, and having no inderstanding of how my actions directly affected you. 
I know there's no way to fix that, no time machine to go back and make amends early enough or event prevent it all from going so badly wrong, and no actions I can take in the present to remove that tarnish from myself, from how you see it or saw it.

I hope you oneday work past what I put you through and get to where you deserve to be, which is happy, free of anxiety and loved.

I doubt my apology will relieve any anxiety and stress caused or are still experiencing at this time. It won't ease my guilt or own current experiences, I hope maybe it helps one day in you attempts to work through it.

Apart from my child, you were the greatest thing to come into my life. I ruined it, i ruined the the best thing to happen to me, that was irreplaceable and now forever irretrievable. And I hurt you and your daughter, probably far beyond my comprehension of such things.

Thats a stain on my concscience that isn't going away. It will haunt me forever, I wish that was hyperbole but its a regular staple of my nightmares.

I do fear just even writing this could be offensive, as I have nothing you want or need. But, in light of the of the state of the world I have to own my actions, apologise for them, and do my level best to be better as a human. To work with my many flaws and grow.

I wish you nothing but the best

Sorry, always.To the only person I’ve ever really loved,

Hey, if I’m bothering you, please tell me and I promise you’ll never hear from me again, but I feel like I owe you a few apologies for the things I put you through a few years ago. 

I never told you how special you were to me. I never told you how much I loved and cared about you and what’s happening in your life. I never showed you or made you feel like you were the most important person in the world to me. Let me correct that, after the things I told you, I made you feel like you were the least important person in my life back then. That was so wrong and I feel awful for doing that to you. Doing that to anyone is so wrong, especially to someone that meant so much to me. 

I’m sorry for the things I said to you back then. I didn’t know how to handle what I was feeling and ended up saying a ton of stupid and horrible things to you. I know that’s no excuse for what I did. That’s no excuse to do that to anyone, especially the person I cared the most about. I acted like I was the victim when I was a murderer and I feel terrible for making you deal with that. I’m sorry it took me over 3 years to feel like I needed to apologize to you. It’s not right that I didn’t realize everything I did wrong until the end of last year. I should have known the problems I was causing you back then instead of recently. I guess that means this apology is late, just like I was for pretty much everything I was involved with you back then. So I’m also sorry for being late to everything, back then and now.

You probably think I’m a coward for writing this and for saying everything I did back then, but what you don’t know is that I think that when I tried reaching out to you nearly a year ago, that was the bravest thing I’ve ever done after everything I did to you. You also probably think I’m a self centered a****** for trying to talk to you after how I treated you and trying to catch up like I didn’t cause you so many problems back then. What you don’t know is that I’ve wanted to talk to you every day since then and its driving me crazy, but I don’t wanna cause you any more problems or bother you since you don’t wanna hear from me.

For those few years, I thought I was over you and my feelings of love went away. I was wrong about that. I thought everything I thought of you was in the past since I never saw you after all my screw ups. Once again, I was wrong. I thought I was done crying over you. I was wrong about that too. I thought I wasn’t still heartbroken over you anymore. I was wrong about that heartbreak. And for the record, you didn’t break my heart, I did it to myself. I broke my own heart over you. You didn’t screw up like I did. I know you weren’t perfect, but I also know that everything that happened was my fault. I did this to myself and I hope it doesn’t bother you the way it bothers me.  I hope you’re happy with your life now that I’m not in it.


I’ve been thinking about you a lot lately. I’ve been wondering how you’re doing now. Do you think about me from time to time? When I reached out to you last August, how well did you remember me and the things I did? Do you remember the things I did right or only the things I did wrong? Do you miss me every once and a while? Cause I miss you and I’m sorry for what I did to you. Do you ever think of texting me about anything? Cause I still hope when I hear my phone go off, every single time, that it’s a text or something or anything from you even though it never is. Not that you should care about that. I also wonder if you have completely moved on and am I forever in your past? If you have, that’s okay, cause I guess that means it doesn’t tear you apart the way it tears me apart. It’s just that it’s killing me to pretend everything’s okay on my end when the reality is that any memory of you from years ago is a reminder of how I screwed up that I can’t shake away from.

I’m not writing this because I’m begging you to be in a relationship with me. I’m not writing this because I’m begging you to forgive me. I’m writing this because I am hoping you’ll understand how awful I feel and how sorry I am. I’d love to tell you this to your face instead of writing you a letter, but since I haven’t seen or bumped into you in about 3 years, so I doubt I’ll ever get the chance to say it to you. It’s crazy to think there was a point in my life when seeing you everyday was normal, when now, I don’t think I’ll ever see you again. I’m guessing about 3 years ago was the last time I’ll ever see you, and I’m also guessing you’re okay with that even though I’m clearly not. I get it that you don’t wanna see me or talk to me anymore. I promise I won’t bother you with my apology.

I won’t bother you anymore.I can’t believe I miss you, after everything. Do you know how much I long to reach out to you? To see you, face to face, for the first time in what feels like forever.

God, I can’t believe how much I want to see you again. To just hear your voice would bring me some sort of twisted relief, even if it means you telling me off just like how I went off on you. I guess you’ve always been my kryptonite.

I miss you. I hate the fact that I miss you. I hate the fact that I hate you too, but I have to. You don’t deserve the space you occupy in my mind. The only thing you deserve is to be alone, but I know that you value being alone so much so that it’s what ultimately led you to pushing me away. 

Goodbye... unless we ever meet again.last night, you slept at her house. why am i surprised? i upset you late afternoon after trying desperately to make you happy, then made it worse by saying things i know i don’t mean. self sabotage is my best skill after all, and most of the time, it’s intentional. 

my sense of self is fleeting, my mind changes on a whim. i thought you knew that by now, i thought you would have seen what i meant by “you don’t want to be with me”. if it’s *this* painful to just be good friends, how do you think it’ll be if we were more? 

to be truthful, there are days where i consider the possibility of giving up on him and seeing how it’ll be with you. but as i said before, i’m not the kind to walk away. being alone is terrifying, and i know you’ll say “well you have me” and i’ll know deep down that you’re right. but what if it doesn’t work, what if i took all that risk at the most life-changing point in my life just to fail? i don’t like change, i don’t like instability, and i don’t like failure. 

what i meant by “it’ll probably never happen” is that i won’t have the guts to walk away, even if i wanted to. i can’t figure out how to make you understand that. my life has been chaos, ups and downs and being thrown off course so far it took months to find its way back. it’s fear, and it’s doubt, and it’s cowardice. 

so while, yes, i can’t say that i will end up with you, i don’t want you to sleep in her bed. you’re mine, even without *technically* being mine. just like i’m yours, without *really* being yours. i can’t stand knowing that you’re there, snuggled up under the blankets with her and not with me. but i guess what goes around, comes around.Hey...

**Let me preface this entire letter by acknowledging  how very unsent it will be. Obviously. However. I’m thinking it’s exactly the only way to communicate with you. And since I’m here. Doing this, I’m going for 100% honesty. With no worries about life. Much like the huge lesson you taught me, albeit not the biggest lesson you taught me, but a big one. Here it goes.**

It’s been so. So. So. Long since we’ve spoken. Which is incredibly sad. I hope you know that. It’s downright heartbreaking. I think of you still often. I find myself having moments where I wonder what your commentary would be to some of the situations I get myself into. Or what you’d do in this particular instance. How you’d analyze what I’m seeing. I wonder what existential connections you’d conclude. Your vision was so peculiar, and spectacular, and thought provoking. 

Your soul was exquisite. And purely unique. True and captivating. 

Please. Feel every word I’m saying right now. Because I can not fully express the sorrow that I feel for what happened—because there are no words that accurately encompass the sorrow I feel. 

I was madly in love with you. Truly. You’ve got to know that. You weren’t crazy. I felt everything I told you I felt. Every single thing. I felt like I had known you my entire life and then some. You had this way of seeing me for...me. Which ok I get it. Sounds so cliche. But its never been more true. See there are so many me’s I guess you could say. Even though we both know you must’ve come to this conclusion already. 

So here’s me, right? And I’m me, with a tinge of whatever the person I’m interacting with wants me to be. And that me, and their tinge become ___ . And everyone that knows me pretty much gets a tingey version of me. That’s what they see. 

But. You didn’t. You saw me. No tinges. Just me. You held me and I felt alive. Like my actual body vibrated. That your skin was electric and magnetic. When you made love to me, I was making real love with someone. For the first and only time in my life. You looked into my eyes, and unfolded my mind with your precise hands and I felt content. 

And I told you all that already. Many times. And many times I knew I fully trusted in another person my mind, body, and soul. 

And I left you. I did. And it kills me every single day. Knowing I hurt you. Knowing I made the choice to walk away. And the way I did it was so incredibly wrong. And hurtful. And mean. And I must’ve caused you great inner turmoil. I’m so very, very, very sorry ______. I’m so. Sorry. 

See I was leaving your house and I was stuck in traffic. I kept going over the incredibly small and meaningless interaction that occurred just before I left. And it was right there. This ah ha moment. Clarity. See, I knew right then I couldn’t be that person in your life. For you, or for me. And I cried. I balled. And cried. And was so angry with myself. For finding everything I’d ever wanted in exactly the wrong person. 

And I’m so very sorry for keeping that moment. And that conversation to myself. It wasn’t fair. And it wasn’t right. You deserved so much fucking more than that. I didn’t give it to you. And when asked my biggest regret in life, this is the moment I go to in my head. Isn’t that hilarious? You would be so upset with me having a regret. You wouldn’t tolerate it. And yet here I am. Without you, and regretful. 

And I deserve that. I deserve all of the shit thrown on me. Every last bit. 

But. Please do know. I loved you more than anything. And I never stopped. My heart still skips a beat when I hear your name. I still smell you in my memories. I can still feel you on me. I dream of you. I miss you so much it’s unbearable most days. 

Thank you so much for being you. And giving me the gift of you all that time ago. 

MeYou should've honestly left this e-mail in the drafts because you sound like the biggest fucking hypocrite in the world. I'm a piece of shit? You're literally using a fake story to attempt to ruin my life over what? Rejection? We're not in high school anymore, P. You have to learn to let shit go. This is honestly the worst thing you've ever done.

I'm glad that you are in a happy and healthy relationship. That's great. I've always wanted that for you and you know that. You are choosing to see me as this dirtbag that you knew in 2012. I'm older than I was back then. I've gained new experiences and new heartbreaks. I genuinely thought we could be friends after all this but you have proven that your friendship was not worth anything. You are a petty garbage human being and I want absolutely nothing to do with you or your "friends." Fuck the apology. I take it back.

You don't know the entire story, P. E is lying to you. E is leaving out important parts of a story that is clearly being twisted to fit a narrative to make me look bad. I'm going to drop it for now, but if I promise that if you go after me again, I will be contacting my lawyer and suing the fuck out of you and every piece of shit liar in your crew of degenerates.

There's never real consequences for my "behavior?" I fucking lost sponsors cause of you and E's lies. I don't know if it was you, E, or M or whatever fucking fake friend did it, but I genuinely hope all of you go to hell. Fuck all of you. You're all fake and I'm super glad I left all you to rot in Miami while I went abroad to do my dream job. For some reason, that pisses you off so much that you have to lie about consensual sex to make me look like an idiot. It's a dishonesty to actual fucking rape victims. You are the reason people don't come out. By all means, believe the lies that E is putting in your head, but leave me out of it. Think whatever you want of me behind closed doors.

You spent hundreds of dollars to come up here and coerce me into sex and sabotage my relationship when we were just supposed to hang out and smoke weed for a week straight. You're a fucking rapist. FUCK YOU.

You lost friends because you are actually a terrible human being and need to grow up. You're fucking 24, P. Stop acting like you're 14 and grow up before I show you what happens to grow up who lie on such a colossal level.

I was legit just trying to be nice to you and hatch things out but for some reason you took that as an invitation to ruin my life. You are the toxic jackass here. The fact that you could manipulate an entire community of people to thinking that untrue things about me is a skill in itself. I shouldn't be surprised. You were always good at coercing people and being overly aggressive.

Like I said, if you feel this way strongly, take me to court, but you won't because you know nothing happened the way that you think it did and I will easily win. Maybe you should try going after actual rapists like E's husband. You should go after actual rapists like A and J. You should go after actual rapists like H, O, L, and their whole team. Let E tell you about the story when she drugged R's drink with roofies and he almost killed himself the same night. Did she ever mention that to you? Probably not.

P.S. Fuck You CuntDear Ex boyfriend,

While you discard person after person and lie to yourself about a perfect love, I reflect on some of the people in my life.....

My Mother works herself into an exhausted mess, discarded by society and abused by past partners. She was abused as a child, her partner was violent when she was in her 20's and her last partner cheated on her and left her. She gave up on romantic love after that. She's been single 15 years now.

My close friend struggles to recover and move past the childhood sexual abuse they survived. They are single and strong.

My sister helps her best friend heal from cancer treatment. He barely survived and she was there every step for him. All the while, my sister is still nursing her heartache from a partner who left her for their alcohol addiction. 

These people in my life are wonderful loving humans. I cannot understand why they suffer, despite working hard to help others (they work in health care and social work) and they do so without the love and support of a romantic partner. 

They work on their own personal growth and to better society. I look up to them and I am thankful that I have them in my life.  I am not perfect, and I'm not nearly as strong as them, but I simply can't believe that you chose not to better yourself. You chose to move on, ignore all that happened, avoid accountability, and say 'I'm sorry for hurting you'. That's it. You forget the whole thing. 

You have ALL of the privileges, while so many suffer alone, and you still refuse to get help. You instead, pretend to yourself that what happened with me was my fault. When you apologized to me you didn't specify what for. Was it the lying? The invasion of my privacy to an illegal level? Pretending to love me romantically so I would stick around and take care of you? No, you won't admit to the details because you'd have to own it... and maybe actually feel sorry instead of pinning it on me.

So, enjoy your new relationship and ignoring everything you've done to hurt other people. 

You broke the last piece of me that was still in tact. I'm trying every single fucking day to rebuild.I am sorry. I mean the previous sentiment with every bit of me there is. Not that it excuses anything I’ve ever done, but I’ve grown more lately than you would ever believe. I’ve come to grips with the fact alcohol brings out all the demons I’ve fought with my entire life, and I’ve taken action about it. I do a lot of thinking these days, and I’ve come to some very important answers about myself and who I used to be. I placed you in a shit situation and continued to ask for you to look beyond all the red flags I couldn’t be bothered to pull out from myself. I want you to know that I will see to it that no one else sees my ugly side the way you did. I am the only project I care about anymore, and I’ll be damned if I don’t finish it. I wish you well, and I appreciate everything you put into us, I appreciate you. I’m sorry I was a pain, and I’m sorry I didn’t give you the me I’ve fallen in love with as of late. Mostly I’m sorry that you’ll never read this.I want to sit on a counter in a sweater five sizes too big and pull you close.

I want to hold your hand in large crowds, not because I won’t be able to find you, but because I don’t want to split up.

I want to hold your bags while you figure out the next step.

I want to keep pace with you, even if it makes my legs hurt.

I want you to notice that my legs hurt trying to keep up with you.

I want to lean forward and eat the dessert from your fork after dinner.

I want to slide my plate to you to try a bit of everything on it.

I want to drink with you after working outside all day.

I want to stand still while you wipe the dirt off my face from when I wiped off the sweat.

I want to mess your perfectly styled hair just enough to break your mask.

I want to wake up 15 min before you and make fresh coffee.

I want to wake up after you and have fresh coffee.

I want to goof around with you and be truly, unashamedly silly without fear of judgement.

I want to have an answer when you ask where your jacket is.

I want to have seemingly meaningful nonsense conversations while staring straight ahead at something beautifully mundane, with just the right lighting to make it seem special.

I want us to end a day dirty, and then, let’s end it dirty.

I want to text you at lunch about nothing, and look forward to doing nothing, but together.

I want to go somewhere new with you, and then take you somewhere new to you.

I want to have no idea how to pronounce the food on the menu, but still laugh at your equally butchered attempt.

I want to show you how to build something.

I want you to show me how to write something.

I want to hear you read the words I don’t know how to say, and hear you understand them better than I do.

I want you to know me like I know you and I want to know you like you know me.

I want to skip ahead two steps, spin back on one foot and face you while we walk and talk.

I want you to catch my arm when I trip from trying to walk backwards on an uneven sidewalk.

I want to show you exactly how good I’ve gotten at improvising my way through shit.

I want to curl up with you under a blanket and watch bad tv adaptations of our favorite comics.

I want to show you something that interests you, instead of the other way around.

I want to understand what you do and why you enjoy doing it.

I want to help you when you need it and accept your help even if I’m too proud to ask for it.

I want to finally finish something and I want to see you start something.

Some day I’ll get to do all of this shit, but with someone else.

So, to the other one: Coffee?I mean I shouldn’t, right? 
I dont know what to feel. 

Part of me says, 
Yes, just move on since she hasn’t tried making connect with you over the last 7 months. She obviously moved on already. 
Every time you tried to say hi, all she ever does is block you. She left you without telling you why. She obviously hates you, doesn’t love you or never cared at all. 

But then the other part of me says, 
No, don’t move on. What we had was real and the things she said she wanted to do with me such as have a family one day or grow old together. Maybe I should wait for her a little longer. 

Lately, I’ve been feeling moreso to yea, it’s time to move on and forget about her. 
She hasn’t said anything to you for 4 months but more like 7 months since 4 months ago was only a few hours of talking before you said we couldn’t talk. 
She hasn’t apologized for the things she has said to me. 
I’m starting to seriously feel nothing towards her. My memories of her are disappearing. 

I dont even remember how she sounds like or looks like. 

I give up honestly. 
Nothing in the last 7 months has shown me that you cared or loved me once. 
Ive wasted my time. 

I’m moving onI miss you. I miss laughing with you. I miss bearing my heart to you and having you do the same. I miss getting to know the inner parts of you. I miss talking you through your troubles and hearing you lighten up while we sorted it out. I miss being able to hug you. I miss your hands on me. I miss texting you random crap throughout the day. I miss our intellectual conversations. I miss sharing music. I miss your singing. I miss planning adventures. I miss hearing you talk about things that you were passionate about. I miss cooking food and talking about God, life, our stupid younger selves, and what the future might hold. I miss our inside jokes. I miss the glint in your eyes when you looked at me. I miss being comfortable with you. 

But I don’t miss feeling like I was never a priority to you. I don’t miss the plans you flaked on, the promises you didn’t keep. I don’t miss hearing you gush over someone else, watching as you ditched me for her. I don’t miss waiting for the phone calls that never came. I don’t miss the unanswered messages. I don’t miss screaming into the void. I don’t miss your apologies and excuses. I don’t miss being disappointed, let down, pushed aside. I don’t miss feeling like that. 

If I were in the same position again, I would do it all the same. So I’m not asking to come back to you. Sometimes I want to. Sometimes I want to give us another shot. But then I don’t want to feel the way you made me feel towards the end. 

So, yes, I miss you. I miss you something terrible. But that doesn’t mean I want you back. if you knew me now, You wouldn’t even know I’m the same person that you couldn’t stand last year.  All the things about me that you didn’t like and brought to my attention during that conversation we had after the beer festival- I took to heart. Even though I deleted it, I still remember that conversation between us Word for Word... because each of those words came as such a shock to me. Even though you apologized after and told me that I didn’t have to change, I spent months working on myself and addressing every single criticism you had given me that day. You were right about everything. I’m truly not mad at you for being honest with me about why you couldn’t stand being around me anymore. When you told me how you really felt about me, how negative and self absorbed I was, it was so so painful to hear... but hearing it come from you turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to me. I was in a dark dark depression for 10 years and I didn’t even realize how bad it was because I was so used to living that way. More importantly, I  didn’t realize how my words and behaviors affected the people around me Until you said something. That’s why I decided to change. Throughout my entire adult life, I knew I was depressed, and I accepted that as my fate. Learning from you that my depression was hurting the people around me who care about me, however... THAT I could NOT accept. 

That conversation with you forced me to look at myself and look inwards and finally be honest with myself about how truly Ill I was. I got help. I got the right doctors I got the right medicine, and for the first time in my life I know what it means to be happy. I never knew happiness...  I never knew stability... all I knew was how to fake a smile, drink my problems away and do whatever I had to do to just survive another day, either that or just sleep all my days away. All those times I canceled plans on you I honestly just couldn’t get out of bed that day. It doesn’t make sense now… It probably doesn’t make sense to anyone who hasn’t experienced clinical depression. I’m so sorry .. I was so stuck just trying to survive that I didn’t think about anybody but myself. I’m sorry I let you down so many times.

Now that I’m OK, it makes me feel sick knowing that I Lived my life that way for so many years and that I was so selfish and inconsiderate Towards the people around me. I was so oblivious when you knew me, I had no idea that my negativity was a burden to others. I took my friendships for granted, I took YOU for granted. You were always there for me, you always listened to me, you tried to help me .. but I was so stuck in my dark hole that nothing you did or said mattered. I can’t imagine how frustrating that was for you And I truly am so sorry. I’m glad you finally said something, even though it hurt me and ended our friendship, because It forced me to open my eyes. I learned how to truly appreciate and be better to the friends that did stick around me after that dark period of my life. I understand why you don’t want to talk to me anymore. And I’m OK with that. What I’m not OK with though, is you never knowing how truly sorry I am for everything.. or you never knowing How truly grateful I am. I know it sounds cheesy… But you really did save my life by giving me that reality check. I just want you to know how much it means to me. I’ll be fine if you never wanna be friends again... even if you did, it probably wouldn’t be the same. And maybe that’s OK. We don’t have to hang out, but maybe we can just respect each other instead of avoid each other... or Maybe you can unblock me on social media and we can follow each other  again and be happy for each other’s life accomplishments lol I don’t know… I’m just throwing ideas out there. 

it’s hard for me to accept that we are practically strangers now,  despite all the years we’ve known each other... but if that’s what you want I can and will accept that. I don’t expect anything from you after reading this, I just needed you to know my apology.You were so sweet, we really were best friends and I valued our friendship so much. You'll never know how much I valued it. I always felt like the outsider of the group and felt like I was imposing myself on all of you because I didn't know many other people there... but you sought me out and actively made me your friend. 
On that night, when everyone was drunk and happy, and you pulled me aside and told me how you really felt, I didn't know how to react. We kissed and it was perfect, but I just couldn't do it. There were so many things you didn't know about me, you didn't know how broken I was. I didn't want to be the one to take your virginity, in some way I don't think I felt like I deserved it. 
I had a shallow crush on somebody else , and I gave you a shitty excuse about not being ready for a relationship. I wasn't the person I am now, I hurt you and I'm sorry for that. You hurt me too though, you didn't want to be my friend if I didn't want to be with you. 
I see the man you've become and I really am proud of you (I'm cheering you on from a distance), but I can't help feeling a little sorry for myself. I don't think you realise that if I had said yes to you back that, my life would have taken a completely different path. I don't regret the path it did take, but I sometimes wonder what would have happened. 
I think if I had paid more attention to you and kept in touch over the years, then maybe we could have had a second chance, but now you're getting married to a girl who looks a bit like me. 
I guess I just want you to know that I'm sorry for whatever pain I caused you, I'm sorry for making you cry. I was too young and stupid to see how amazing you were. You look happy now and I'm glad for that.I fell in love with the way you made me feel. I didn’t reciprocate it, and it was too late when I realized I never gave you enough. You made me feel seen, loved, special, extraordinary. I never took the chance to tell you that you are all of those things and more, and I just can’t forgive myself. I told you I loved you but never told you why, and that’s important. I see that now, but I’m afraid I’m just too late. You weren’t wrong for giving up on me. I just wish I’d given into you more. I love you for all of the amazing things you are, not just all of the amazing things you made me feel. I’m sorry, for what it’s worth, for loving you so selfishly. I miss you so much.K, I’m sorry that I assumed so much about you and treated you like my assumptions were true.

I’m sorry I got resentful and treated you like shit. If I had just talked to you, it would have saved me a lot of resentment, which would have saved you a lot of heartbreak. I regret not just using my fucking words. I got everything so wrong and you didn’t even know what was happening until you were hurting too much to have the conversation I should have initiated months before.

I’m sorry that I wasn’t accountable for my behavior. It’s not your fault that I didn’t apologize, it’s not your fault I treated you like shit—that was all me, I made the decision to do all of that and you didn’t deserve it.

I’m sorry I made you do all of the vulnerable work. I was so busy thinking about myself and my own fears, I didn’t even consider that you were doing all the brave communicating I should have been doing—even though you were just as afraid as I was. I didn’t consider you could be afraid. I didn’t consider you were human and therefore it’s impossible to predict things about you. I dehumanized you.Dear friend, it’s been over a decade and the regret I feel at not meeting you to celebrate being done with finals still haunts me in the most surprising moments.  I chose to spend that day drinking instead with people who are no longer in my life. I think about your texts asking where I was and I get so sad. I’m sorry for letting you down. 

We still talk every once in a while, but I wonder a lot about what if....what if I had gone? Would our relationship have changed that night? Would all of the things we share in common and our ability to talk to each other for hours about anything have led to love? 

You were so hard to read sometimes, because like we discussed once, if you weren’t sure the other person was all in, you were hesitant to express your feelings. I just want you to know, I would have been all in with you. 

My life is a happy one now, and I hope yours is too. I pray that whoever you end up with knows how wonderful you are and loves you the way you deserve.I’m sorry to my neighbors if it ever smells of weed. If I ever get enthusiastic with the guitar, even though I barely play and when I do, I close everything so you don’t have to listen.

I’m sorry to my friends for taking so long to answer. For not being there when I wish I could. For getting caught up in my own anxieties and disappearing for hours or days or weeks. For having so much trouble visiting.

I’m sorry to my sister for not being there, and not having done anything to get close. I’m sorry for the things you saw when you were little and I was a messed up teen. I’m sorry for the bad influence and everything that caused you pain. I’m sorry for writing this here instead of telling you.

I’m sorry to my parents for not being the person they would have liked me to be. Someone that’s happy and love themselves. Someone that can function and they don’t have to worry so much about. I’m sorry for not being able to give back. I’m sorry for all the pain I caused you. I’m sorry for trying to kill your daughter some years ago.

To myself, I’m sorry for feeling sorry. For making everything so hard. For the damage and self harm I did in the past. For still not knowing how to take care of you. For thinking your illnesses make you less worthy of everything. For the high standards. For allowing you to think you’re doing this to yourself. For pushing people away. For thinking you’re gross or ugly, that you don’t deserve anything good because you’re a waste of space and resources. For not recognizing the work you are doing and the effort you put into it. For diminishing your talents. For not embracing you and loving you, and being proud for getting this far.I apologize. Constantly. So I know it’s a little hypocritical of me to be mad every time I read your messages that say “I’m sorry,” but I just can’t get over the fact that you blame yourself. 

Especially after tonight.

You knew I was down, so you tried really hard to bring me back up. We talked all weekend about me, and how I feel towards another girl that I know. You encouraged me to try and see where she leads me, since, I haven’t been very motivated to achieve that whole “high school experience” thing everyone raves about.

Come to find out, she had a girlfriend already.

Oh well, all that I really care about is the fact that she’s happy. She never knew my real intent either, so I can just keep talking to her as a friend, which is plenty of human companionship for me. But ever since I messaged you and told you that she was in a relationship, you’ve apologized profusely. You keep telling me that you’re sorry for dragging me into this situation, when I myself couldn’t be more grateful. You tried to help me, and maybe there isn’t a pot of gold at the end of every rainbow, but it makes me happy that you really tried for me.

I’ve tried telling you this too, but I guess you’ll never understand. So please stop apologizing, ok? It’s not your fault, and it honestly pisses me off that you would ever get so down on yourself.Do they ever feel remorse for what they’ve done? Am I going to be sitting in my deathbed, hating myself for waiting for an apology that I’ll never get?I'm sorry that I'm so broken.

I'm sorry that I think the worst of myself, and it's almost impossible to convince me otherwise.

I'm sorry that I hurt so much during panic attacks and you have to watch it happen.

I'm sorry that I've been so unbelievably sad.

I'm sorry that I let you down when you needed me.

I'm sorry that letting you in is so difficult.

I'm sorry that you have to deal with me.

I want to be better. I love you so much. It's always been you. I don't know how to make this rightI just want you to realize that you’re a piece of fucking garbage for how you treated me and left me hanging with so many unanswered questions and feeling the lowest I ever felt in my life. Fuck you.One of the repercussions of loving you as completely and unconditionally as I do is that I hold you to a standard of perfection. I think so much of you that I expect you to do things the perfect way. I don't see things the way they really are. It's almost like I see you as some personification of a deity or God. When I look at you, I don't see anything that could be interpreted as negative or sub-par. I just see what I believe is the best person I know.

Whether it's the way you walk or wipe your eyes when you're tired. Whether it's the way you breathe steadily or the way you smell when you've went a couple days without a shower. It doesn't matter, really, because whatever it is that you do, I'm going to love it because you did it. Does that make sense? That's why I want you to know that no matter what, I'll stay by your side.

I know you well enough to know how you think and how you operate. I know the subliminal messages you send and the things you wanna say but don't. I know you really are the best person I know. Even though you may not meet anybody else's standard of a perfect person, you continually meet mine and so much more.

I think this is why I get so upset sometimes. Because I feel like I'm not good enough for you and I can't comprehend why. I wanna be your best friend more than I want literally anything else in this whole world. I want to be the person you can depend on for anything. I want to be special to you, the way you're special to me. I like to be shown I'm more important than others, and that a part of you wants to take the time to show me I'm your best friend, too.

In having this kind of outlook and attitude, it's easy to forget that you're a person, too. You get sad, mad, scared, and worried just like anybody else. There are times when you come to me because you know I can pick you up when you're being knocked down or overwhelmed. I don't expect you to be in a vulnerable position because in my mind, you're in complete control of everything. I realize I'm wrong for doing this, but I just can't help it. I don't want you to ever feel like there are these unrealistic standards and expectations you have to live up to to please me. I promise that whether you win, lose, or draw I'm going to be just as happy and proud of you for doing whatever it is you did.

There's no right or wrong ways of doing things in my eyes. As long as you do what makes you happy, then I will ultimately be happy. So do not feel pressured or like you've got to be someone your not. Doing that is what would cause me to be disappointed. As long as you're being true to you, and doing what you know to be the right thing, I'll never be upset with you. When I say that I just want for you to be happy, I sincerely mean that. Plain and simple. Happy you equals happy me.

I'm sorry for making it seem like you have to try to be someone you're not. I don't realize that I'm doing that. No matter what you do, I'll never leave you to be alone and scared. You can always depend on me to have your back and be the very best friend that you deserve. In my eyes, you deserve the world. I'm going to keep doing my part in making sure you get it, too. For that's what makes me most happy. Hearing your laugh and seeing your smile are how I get paid. And I've never been as rich as I am right now. Thank you for being the best to me. You'll always be my number one. Forever and always. Love you.I wish I knew what I was doing was hurting all of you. It makes more sense now why you all left without saying goodbye. I made you feel irrelevant, not appreciated, undesirable when we were all looking for the same thing. I wish someone told me long ago but what's the point when all you see is someone who never cared. It seems that the world has to come crashing down to make someone finally realize  they need to change. Learn to understand what they never understood. To change things that they never knew existed before. That person has come so far in so little time. I have faith in them and would be proud of the effort they are making to be more.  They have amazing resilience to have made it this far. One day I would like to see this person and the positive influence they created where once they cause chaos.You don't have good boundaries, so you don't even realize how rude I was, or how badly I messed up. I can't just say that it was wrong that I let us become close friends because that is confusing and you aren't responsible for that. I do not want to overwhelm you with my guilt but it's not like I am walking around like normal after hurting your feelings like I did. I haven't been able to do homework, eat, or talk to my friends. I am filled with remorse, and I hope you don't think that I wanted any of this to happen. I really, really messed up. And there's not much else I can do about it. I want to delete all of my social media and just forget any of this ever happened but that would be running away from it. I am trying really hard to take this head on. I am scared to send my apology note to you. I am scared that you want revenge. But please understand that I am trying to make things right. My morals have finally returned to me and it is horrifying and it is freaking me out and I wish I wasnt dealing with this alone. I'm so sorry.I forgive you, I know you don’t need forgiveness or you never asked for it but I still do. It’s long overdue because I’ve been holding onto this for too long.

I do want you to know though that you hurt me when you didn’t mean to, I was going through something at the time and I was trying to escape that hell and walked in to you doing the same to someone else and had to relive everything but from a different view.

I can’t blame you for the way I feel because you weren’t trying to hurt me. I took offense to something that wasn’t done to me.

I guess I’m a way this is my way of moving on from the way I felt about you and to try to become a better son to you mom.I'm sorry that I wasn't enough for you, which feels like an odd thing to apologize for. Almost the opposite of accepting a compliment for the name your parents chose.

I miss you. Why do I miss you? I miss your dog. I miss your hands. I miss the pasta that you always overcook.

Maybe some day i'll move to the East Coast and we'll meet again at a grocery story and talk about how terrible college was. Or maybe we won't.

I miss you dude. I hope you're so happy climbing mountains in Montana. I hope you find peace. I hope you don't hurt other girls on accident again. I hope you find closure and learn to love yourself again. I hope you learn how to cook pasta too.There are so many things I wish I could say to you. 

So many wasted moments and every moment that passes is another moment that nudges you away from me.

Are we already at the destination? Did we miss the journey?

Sometimes the journey is more beautiful than the destination.

Right now, the destination is unknown.

So this is goodbye for now, Not goodbye forever. 

I will see you again because sometimes goodbye is just the beginning.I’m sorry. It never should’ve happened this way but it did. In truth this is the last time I’ll apologize to you for existing. It’s not my fault that you put no effort into our friendship. You drove me to be pushy because I was under the impression that this relationship was necessary to my survival. That was my first and most fatal mistake. What was I to you anyway? Just something to pass the time until you could move along? I guess that’s what everyone is to everyone but even still, it’s not fair. At least if doesn’t feel fair. All of the time and effort we both used to put in. It was a lot of fun but it was hard to maintain, like any friendship. I just wish you had told me straight out. Said you didn’t want to be friends or you didn’t have the time. I could have respected that. But you broke me. And I’m not apologizing for that anymore. It’s your turn, and I’m not waiting anymore.We are never, ever, ever, EVER going to talk again unless you apologize. And not that ONE apology you gave me that ONE time about "not trying to understand me better"--that's not what you did. I want you to apologize for the stuff you actually did, not some sugar-coated version that relieves you of accountability. You didn't "not try to understand me better" you actively projected your worst fears onto me and painted me as a villain in your head, and then treated me like someone who wanted to hurt you. That goes beyond "not trying to understand me better." If you're unsure about the impact your behavior had on me, you're going to have to

ask,sit down,and listen.

It's not going to be a five minute conversation where you apologize for something you don't even understand. We aren't going to pretend this is okay. NO. This hurt ME, it hurt YOU, and WE need to talk about it so that WE can heal and learn from it.

I'm not initiating the conversation.I'm not gonna be the first to share my feelings just so you can shut down and say nothing in return.I'm not gonna hold YOUR hand through a tough conversation as if you're the only one on this planet who's scared. You're scared so my feelings don't matter? That's how it works? You get to treat me like shit and it's okay because you're scared, and I'm? What? Your personal punching bag? Do you think I am fearless and that when people treat me badly it doesn't affect me?

You seemed to think that I'm some kind of courageous valiant deity who is excellent at communication and strong enough to take your bullshit. NO. I was scared as fuck. I learned my communication skills from PTSD therapy because of all the trauma I have been through--not from a happy loving family. In fact, I would even say I was as scared as you. I continuously faced my fears with you. I want you to take vulnerable risks in conversation, because I want you to see first hand how fucking SCARY it was for me when I was trying to start conversations with you about stuff that was important to me and you would cut me off mid-sentence, tell me you didn't care, tell me it wasn't important, or try to change my mind.

If you ever, ever, ever want me to talk to you, if you ever want to have a real interaction with me EVER again, that is what you are going to have to do. There is no sweeping under the rug. There is no letting bygones be bygones. I have to deal with the pain of a situation that \*you\* put me in because you did not take the time to repair the damage you caused.Hey,

I'm sorry I punched a hole into your life that day.  I'm sorry I crashed on your couch, and cooked your meals, and listened to your boring work stories, and fornicated with you between 1 and 4 times a week.  I'm sorry I took you on weekend trips up the coast, or wined and dined you; I'm sorry if you fell in love.  I'm sorry that one day I punched a hole out of your life without explanation.  

You were a good person.

\-The Kool-Aid ManOne will leave you waiting , all ready for your date, for 2 hours, after a hard work day without as much as giving you a heads up he'll be late, no apologies, just excuses. Time after time, argument after argument. He'll fight with you and blame you for everything, make you feel worthless, guilty that men are interested in you, tell you that YOU make him want to kill himself when you confront him about his cheating and lies, make you depressed and make you want to be single forever because he made you believe you're the worst girlfriend and person there ever was.


And then there's men who'll catch a 7hr flight, rent a car and drive for 7 hours to spend a weekend with you and your family. He's trying to learn your language so he can talk to them, he's buying presents because "it's rude to show up empty handed" and make you laugh with tears.
He's your partner and this might not be a forever kind of thing, but this man saved your life, raised your standards and made you love yourself for who you are...


I wish I could give him the world.I'm so sorry. We met in a time where I was in my lowest point in life, and I can't express how bad I feel for putting so much pressure on you. It was not your fault for changing how you acted around me, it was mine for behaving in a way that forced you to react like you did. I would have done the same thing. I am thankful for everything you did for me, and I will cherish all the good memories that we created in our better times.

(A bit of context:) I was severely depressed and dropped out of school. I only had one guy as a friend that would play games with me online (never met him irl) and that was the only thing that kept me going trough my days - that I atleast have this person to talk to. In the end I was acting so obsessive around him, I was mad if he was too busy to play with me even after a single day. He eventually ghosted me, blocking me everywhere. This all now lies a few years in the past, I've gotten help and am in a much better place in life right now. In hindsight I can now see everything he did for me, and how badly I treated him for it. I randomly saw him in a Game we used to play, but he blocked me after my first message. I hope maybe I can find some peace of mind just by writing it here, even if he won't read it.You cheated on me with a boy and didn’t apologize. 

You knew what I went through with my dad and still chose weed over me and didn’t apologize. 

You led me on for two years and once we started dating you broke up with me a month later because you didn’t see a future and yet again you didn’t apologize. 

Why is it you never apologized to me?

What did I do to you that was so bad?

Who raised you to be a heartless monster?

Did you use me the whole time? 

I’m left with so many lose ends and question and no way to get the answered. 

I can’t even tell my friends I love them anymore I’m so afraid of abandonment. 

Congrats tho you ruined my future relationships wether it be romantic or not. 

Where’s my apology?I wish to be as happy as I was with you. Since the happiest days of my life we spent together. What I wouldn’t give for one more of those days.fuck you for making me so fucking afraid everytime a man touches me. fuck you for making me afraid of men looking at me. of them raising their voice. of anyone getting upset with me. for making me feel so fucking bad about standing up for myself that i never do it anymore because you have created a male archetype that every man after you has filled, the ones that get upset when they don't like what you're saying and they flip it onto you until you're crying wondering what you did wrong. fuck you for making my first sexual experience an invasion of my soul, something that cracked me to my core. fuck you for making me feel inadequate even when you assaulted me, making me feel like i will never be satisfactory to any man since you were the easiest to please. fuck you for screaming at me, for cornering me, for gaslighting me and making me feel like the bad guy when i caught you in breaking me more and more. for making me the bad guy when you weren't loyal, replacing dishonesty for transparency. fuck you for lying every single day to me. fuck you for not caring about me. fuck you for being the first guy i let in that much, and fuck you for pissing all over what you saw. making it yours. making sure it's your face i see in my nightmares, your voice i hear when someone raises theirs, your hands touching me when the 3 other guys did to me what you did-at least they weren't sober. you were. you knew what you were doing. you knew you were breaking me beyond repair. fuck. you. i hate you. i hate you. a million times over i fucking HATE YOU. you raped me. you lied to me. you cheated on me. you made me into who i am now. you were the one who was supposed to apologize, not me. it should've been you who had to sit there while i was telling you how inhuman you were and it should've been you who had to explain what the fuck i was to you. i was never the bad guy. i was just trying my best. and i was blinded by you and your manipulative nature. fuck you. fuck you. fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you. you are the reason everyone after you is put off by what they see. you are the reason i feel impossible to love. you have tainted me. you have scarred me. you have broken me. you gave me trauma. and depression. and wanting to die more than anything else i want out of life. and the anxiety i feel that bubbles up in my throat every time another man comes close enough to touch me or speak to me. you are the reason i fucking hate myself. you are the reason i look in the mirror and turn away in disgust. you are the reason i lose touch with my reality, any reality you exist in is one i dont want to be aware of. you are the reason i find it impossible that anyone on this entire planet would actually want to be near me, let alone try to
love me. fuck you. you are nothing but a fucking nightmare and i hate you beyond words can describe.I was the one reached out. I was the one who messaged first. I was the one who wanted it to keep going. And I was the one who messed up. I forgot to answer... just a single day had passed. I could've still messaged something. But no. I was scared, and instead of sending something, anything... I let time pass. It's been about a month. 

I opened a message and never responded, because I didn't know what to say. 

I'm sorry, God I'm so sorry. The funny thing is, I reached out to you because of how much fun I had that night with your friends. Just lounging around and laughing at every scene of 50 shades of grey. It doesn't really matter what I say now. That day ended and passed. One of your friends said I was one of the bois now.... even then I knew I wouldn't last. 

It never does. I'm just sorry I didn't respond. Good luck senior year; I can only wish you the best!

Bye NSHey you.

If I could only tell you one thing. It'd be an apology. I was afraid. I was afraid of the world. I was afraid of being embarrassed. I was afraid of being wrong. I was afraid of being a failure. I took it out on you. I didn't know I was doing that. I was just a scared nothing. An angry nothing. A terrified nothing. And without you, nothing. You were the kindest, most helpful caring person. I've wasted my life, Scared and unmedicated. You didnt deserve any of that. It's been so long. I'm afraid to look you up or write to you. But, I feel like we're running out of time. If I can't make things right, and I'm not asking for forgiveness, but it wasn't you. I was out of control. I was the problem. I was sick. Mental illness. You were so amazing and talented and smart. I was just a sheltered idiot. Our friendaversary is coming up. Try and remember something happy about me, okay? I was an asshole, but I wasn't your enemy. I want to say more, but I don't want to talk about myself. you know? You were truly loved even though I was a crazy person and gave you so much hurt.

I am so sorry rdfh11cHey

Despite us starting to speak again after so many years, there are things that will forever be left unsaid

When I met you, I took you for granted, thought you would be there no matter how shitty my attitude towards you could be at times

I ignored your goals without realizing it, at the time everything took me by storm and it all was thrown against you

It was the moment I realized this that I left you...
I left you because I realized that I was the reason you were suffering
I left you because I was in the way of all you wanted to do
You never did anything to me except make me happy, you gifted me with some of the only memories where I remember being happy

I should have listened to you, I shouldn’t have listened to anyone else, but I did and things turned out for the worst

These thoughts have plagued my mind every single day for the last years

But they will forever be left unsaid, unheard

So this is it.. my silent apology to you
And you will never even have to hear itI didn’t want to be like this, and you don’t deserve what I did to you. I lead you on, even when I knew it wouldn’t happen. I know we are still friends, but I still feel terrible for how I made you feel and how I did it. If I could go back and redo, I would make it easier for you, and I wouldn’t have waited so long. I’m sorry. I hope you understand that I really truly thought that I meant what I said. Just because I didn’t doesn’t mean I hate you though. I was very confused, and honestly still am. Despite the fact that you will never hear this or read this. I am sorry.

Sincerely, someone who made some mistakesI guess this is goodbye I never thought that I would have to say this but I truly have to say it because I feel like I messed up big-time I don't know how else to fix all of this I wish I knew but I don't and I miss you I miss everybody I miss everything I wish everything could go back to the way it was but I know I messed everything up and I know it'll never be the same as it was it ever again and I wish I never did the things that I did but I just hope that all everybody can accept my apology even you I just hope that everything can be okay again eventually in the future and then maybe I can be front we can all be friends again but I don't know if that's not what you guys want but that's what I want and I hope that everything goes okay and I hope that you guys are okay.Dear mom and dad,

I'm sorry I'm not the daughter you wanted to have. I'm sorry I'm a disappointment. I'm sorry you cant find a reason to be proud of me. I'm sorry that I'm messy and expensive and dramatic and bratty and mean and a bore and a pain and everything else. I'm sorry that I lie. I'm sorry that I'm so insecure. I'm sorry that I've tried on selves to try and find one that fits only to give up and become a cardboard cutout once more. I'm sorry that I keep getting hurt and never learn from my mistakes. I'm sorry that I make so many mistakes all the time.

I'm sorry.I am sorry.  I understand there is nothing else I can do.  But I am sorry for my behaviors and working real hard to change for the better.  I am sorry for being mean and saying awful words to you.  I hope we can move on from this one day. I know I plan to. This apology is from the heart. You know it is.  It is what it is is what I say. Sorry for not humbling myself more.  I am sure I disappointed you. As I did to others. 

Have a good day. I still love you.You're still unaccountable. Thank you for setting me free, the energy you have for me is debilitating. You didn't leave nothing to show for your love--the way you treated me taught me exactly what to avoid. I'm not going to thank you for that because you could've taught me the same lesson with love. Forgive yourself, you're the one who fucked this up for yourself and you're the one who is gonna live with the regret.I cried when I read your message and as I write this letter I’m crying again. All these tears have to be for something, right? 

You messaged me when I needed you most.  You told me to get away from him, I already had but you just saying that confirmed my leaving was a wise decision. I have heard of physically abused women having a difficult time leaving, but I was being emotionally abused. 

You told me he needed professional help, something I had thought as well. I had asked him about mental illness in his family, sharing with him my struggles and that of a schizophrenic cousin. I loved this person, and wanted to share every aspect of my life with him, even the ugly. I wanted to know every detail about him, even things that were less than flattering. 

You told me people in his mental state will lie, he had already lied, it’s why I left him. He says cruel and mean things to me and others and just moves alongs as if it’s their problem. He’s incapable of a true apology, it’s not in his nature to recognize the pain he causes others with words. He never apologized to me, which is ironic, because an apology on behalf of him is why I contacted you in the first place. I felt so bad for the words he said to you, how rude and mean he was. You saw the side of him I had. You understand my pain, although a huge difference is you didn’t love him like I did. I wanted to give him everything his heart could desire. I felt for him the  way I know my new lover feels for me. It feels good to be so wanted and desired, I guess my want and desire was not enough for him.  

I loved him, I hate that about me now, it makes me feel stupid. I feel stupid.  

Your words meant the most to me at this point, when you said that just reaching out to you,  to apologize for how he treated you, showed what kind of person I am. You called me kind and nice.  I cried so hard at this point because that’s what I want to be. Thank you for reminding me that I still am. Hey, it’s Me. 

I’ve been wanting to send this for the longest time, but I’m not sure how it would be received.

We left on a bad note and I apologize. 

I apologize for all of the pain you put me through. 

I apologize for not being enough when you expected a young woman to know what she wanted while still yearning for your desolate touch.

I apologize for giving my innocence and all of myself to You. 

I apologize for getting my hopes up. 

I apologize for when you cried the first time you entered me, coming to Jesus knowing that this woman deserved better than Your meaningless insertion. 

There is one thing I will never regret - You leaving me. 

You painted me to be a shell of a woman, not capable of living up to the expectations you set for yourself. 

You were right, I was not ready. 

Now after breaking me down, Your disapproval has fueled me from within to be all the things You could never be. 

You will never be brave.

You will never be vulnerable.

You will never feel the warmth of being in these caring arms. 

You will never know the strides I have made to be the woman you always wanted but was too cowardice to love.

You will never be able to call me up late at night again hypnotizing me with promises of your love.

And above all, you will never know what it would have been like to be with Me.This won't be like my other letters to you. There won't be any outpours of love, only a collection of facts and thoughts. The mystical power of the point of view that will differ from yours. But I know you won't stop, you won't care, you won't listen. You never do, after all. So and unsent letter it will be. After all, you're furious and I just don't care enough anymore to do anything else.

When you first barged into my life I didn't want you around. The only reasons I responded were boredom and fascination with your intellect. I wasn't looking for love or any kind of relationship, that just happened. You said *I love you* first. I hesitated. Love? After two days? Ridiculous. But I couldn't overlook the connection we had. The coincidences that seemed hellbent on bringing us together. And then it happened. Your first meltdown over something small. It was a major red flag that I ignored. I was a fool. And I was too lonely to want to notice the truth. It only continued, as weeks went on, you would leave me and come back apologising. A weekly ritual. It was a major drain on my sanity, and you knew full well what my mental state was before. So one day, after you came back and still couldn't accept that I had a life before you, I said something irresponsibly stupid. I think that subconsciously I just wanted this whole thing to end. But my conscious mind had different plans.

A few days later I reached out to you, missing you, still in love with you. You couldn't forgive me. Still, for the sake of my deteriorating mental state, you agreed to friendship. We spent hours talking. You said you were going on a trip and that there was a man who had feelings for you, with whom you planned to move on with. **That was devastating**, but I held back my feelings wanting to merely be a friend and, with time, move on myself. I helped you calm down when you started panicking about a health issue and you even thanked me for caring so much that I spent hours calming you down. Then I made a joke. Fitting one for a friend to make, terrible for a boyfriend to make. Had you not dumped me days prior I wouldn't have said that. You got mad, said that I didn't care about you and left.

You came back, as you always did, with apologies in tow and I stupidly let you back in. But there's always something. There's always pain you bring with you. As I was showing you something, you spotted that I was browsing a certain subreddit. You knew what mental state you left me in, you knew that I was all alone with it and you, yourself suggested that I seek out companionship. Despite it being **before** you came back, despite **knowing and confirming** yourself that I **didn't act on it** and knowing full well that all I needed was someone to talk with. But you thought that I'm a cheater anyway. I could've done it, but I didn't. But that doesn't mean anything you. Just like the fact that you've pushed me further and further away with each argument we had. Yet, I remained loyal, I have a clean conscience. **You went on a week-long trip with another guy** after being rather clear what you think of me and what you plan on doing with him. **Yet I remained loyal.** But I am the bad guy. Because I **considered** talking with someone **about you** after you ripped my heart to shreds.

You made me into a monster in your head. You tried to hurt me with vicious words but that mostly failed. You can't use the same arguments I used against myself to make me feel bad. When someone already sees themselves as ugly and stupid you repeating it won't change much. Everything else you've mentioned was things that you wanted, not me. Living in a huge city, when I run from one for some peace and quiet, wasn't as enticing as you think. **You were the only reason I even entertained the idea.** Going back to college? I considered that a waste of time with my lengthy résumé, but **I'd do it for you**. The only thing you were right about was me being always online, seemingly having no life. Only you forgot that you met me during a global pandemic and I live in a place where the situation is getting worse daily. Am I supposed to party every day? Preposterous. Safe to say, all you provided me with was a boring rant.

Now you're publically calling me a psychopath and kink-shaming me. Just about the only thing that could annoy me, but ultimately harmless. Most people have some kinks, even you, but I'm mature enough to stay quiet on the matter. You see, I never opened up to you, not really. I had my insecurities used against me once before, so my trust in women isn't what it used to be. I'm sorry about that *(not really)*. I'm also sorry about the fact that you allowed yourself to be manipulated by a boy who made multiple accounts to follow you, the same man who called your phone from a new number each time you blocked him, the same person who lied to you about me before. Yes, and you call me a psychopath while letting one whisper bullshit into your ear.

I never lied to you and I never would've. I never wanted anything but happiness for you. I truly cared for you. I loved you. Even after you revealed that you were still married weeks into our relationship. I loved you. Now, however, I see what you are. I pity you. You call me a small man, but even I wouldn't try to publically humiliate someone like you're trying to humiliate me. I trusted you and even if you felt that your trust has been abused, to make a public performance of it is simply immature and pathetic. Especially since you yourself said that internet relationships aren't real in our last conversation, so what's the point again?

I'm not ever heartbroken, since you broke my heart some time ago and it didn't have the time to heal. This was just dull pain. I hope you'll get some satisfaction from this. Just remember, no turning back this time. There's nothing waiting for you here anymore.That's assuming that I was wrong. That my abandonment issues were over reacting, that you could be frustrated with me without falling out of love..without hating me. You told me to stay,that relationships have issues that we could work through them. I heard you but I couldn't believe it. Not after what you had said about me behind my back, how could you possibly want someone like that to stay? Even knowing it's fucked up and wrong,growing up love was conditional and they kept score. Every mistake, every annoyance was a reason to hate me. I guess I'm still hard wired to believe that even if it's not how i love others. In my mind at the time,and still a bit now, the fact i had annoyed you,upset you, that's unforgivable,you probably hate me,and even if you dont you deserve better than me. Ridiculous and dramatic? probably but thats how love always worked in my family and other relationships. I'm not an awful person I dont fully hate myself but I never felt good enough for you. You were smart,funny, strong and intimidating,yet still if you payed attention the big tough facade covered someone so protective and loving. You could see it with your family,your friends,and I think with me. I was always happy having you around,even on the days that my moodiness fucked me over. Your laugh, your hand in mine... I don't know how to discribe it. Love I guess. But still I ran,you were calmly trying to reason with me still I ran off crying. I wish I had listened. I wish I had told you right off the bat I saw screenshots. I wish I had gone to you first. I wish i hadn't of let my moodiness get the best of me. Mostly now i wish there was still hope for us. I'm terrified of reaching out,I have no clue how you view me anymore. I just know no matter how much i try to force myself to not,I'm still in love with you, and I miss you terribly.

anyways.. I hope you're doing well.You messaged me again updating me briefly about your life. You have so much control that such small updates, these brief 9 lines of text can soothe my heartache and the anxiety of separation. I can see you want to make conversation and with ease, you get over things like you always do. But that’s not the case for me. I left you on read because I do not know how to tread this anymore, even if done carefully, I know the pain will magnify and engulf me once more.

You have a way of coming back, not exceeding a week of no contact but yet still breadcrumbs, weak efforts as if I’m a low hanging fruit. It’s not enough for me and yet I hate how I still want to engage and re-enter this vicious cycle with you once more. To be entrenched in this painful cycle and compromise my self-worth. I need to stop.I apologize for not stopping to listen to what you have to say. I saw dedication and sincerity with the way you approached me. You even said I didn't have to worry coz you weren't a scammer and it'll only be a quick talk.

But mister, I'm feeling really unwell that time. I tried to explain to you that I couldn't talk to you because I was afraid I'd get you sick but you turned your back to run and get the stuff you want to show me. Our conversation happened so fast but I couldn't wait for you to face me back.

I swear I wasn't being rude. I was just not feeling well. I felt dizzy and my head was pounding. I think I was feeling warmer than usual too and with all the hype about the covid virus, I know I should know better and just keep my distance from everybody else even if I think I don't have the virus and that I wasn't terminally ill yet.

The way you approached me that time kept echoing in my head. I've never felt this guilty after refusing a random offer/convo. Hope you're doing good, though.Now that I'm with somebody else, I look at us in a more calm and rational State of Mind. I don't love you. I also don't hate you. you are not a bad person. The decisions you've made we're very conniving and selfish. Nobody's Perfect though. Anyway, I will see you in court.What was meant to be a unsentletter, spiraled...

&nbsp;



Curiosity raised,

Desire lit

Wandering thoughts...

Keenly they’re aware — my mask was evident

Think they notice *every* bit?

The language of your body:

Speaking vulnerability, confidence, dominance?

Sitting legs splayed

Wandering eyes, I want.

Oh no, they definitely noticed.

No, stop, I may hurt too many.

Plus, I’m undeserving.

It’s all so foggy

Breath hot and heavy.

Stop breathing so you can see?!

Did they just promise safety?

What do you want from me?

Do they see?

No they can’t possibly,

Shrink smaller, the thoughts will shrink too?

&nbsp;


Dreamt of you in my bed?!

Bewildered you hit that depth in my head.

Haven’t had a dream like that in a long time.

Intimidation and interpretation.

One intense look and I’ll be done.

Oh fuck me, I want to...

&nbsp;


Avoid eye contact!!!

Only listen to voice

But wait, was that the word shower?

Oh fuck, now thoughts wander.

Maintain avoidance of eye contact!!

But, oh look, a bed...

Visions of us under sheets in my head

Definitely turning red.

Nope not working!

Only option now is eye contact,

Pretend to look without looking?

Licking lips, oh shit.

Are they trying to undo me?!

Yes, yes they fucking are.

No, they may just be hungry for, hmm... food?

&nbsp;


Another dream, are my desires this extreme?!

Maybe they desire me too?

Definitely not anymore,

Disappointment pervade in place

As what more could they do!

They gave the power, remember?

Foolish, they offered plenty!

&nbsp;


Stop it with the mask!!!!

Playing naïveté only bodes to it.

They’re most certainly deserving!

I must clarify.

Quiet the voices.

Balance yourself.

Not just all internal,

external.

&nbsp;

Go apologizeI am being as genuine as humanly possible when I apologize for putting you in uncomfortable situations. 

I understand you need space and time to recharge, logically but in the moment all I saw was an opportunity for everyone to see how great you are. I just got so excited getting to know you and seeing how awesome you are that I immediately connected you with other people in my mind and keow they would love you too! Be it shared interests or similar opinions, etc. 

I was excited and in that,  completely forgot your comfort zone. I don't ever want you to experience anything negative mental or emotional state, especially at my hand. I overlooked your feelings, in black and white.  

And I'm writing this because I know you need to recharge and I don't want to impede any further.  I didn't know when enough was enough for you. And thank you for the friendship you gave me with the trust to never overstep even though I did. I am so sorry to put you in the spotlight without concerning myself as to even think you didn't want it.

You're a  wonderful person and your introversion isn't something to overcome.  It's a part of you.

" I'm sorry" won't fix anything but I needed to get it out.

Edit: They reached out this morning and told me how they felt. We're still friends, they understood my intentions weren't bad, and from now on we have a codeword for when they need to leave/be alone/recharge or when I'm pushing too hard. They're not going out for a while so we'll just stick to one on one friend time. Thank you guys for your kind words and advice!I'd say this to a few people if I could, and hope that I could look into their eyes when I did. And that they could peer back into mine, which are looking much less flat, empty and hollow as of late. There's a hint of that old glint - but a poet I'm not, nor much of a writer. So I'll get on with it, and say it you.

I can't take back my actions or my words. I've always been a proponent of owning ones' mistakes, and I'm owning mine. All I can do is learn as I go, change, and grow. If I've offended you, and you wish to hurt or offend me, I can understand that. I won't ask you to stop, I will ask for no quarter, and expect none to be given. I'm not a saint by any means, and I'm realistic. Sometimes even pragmatic. I'm human, of course if you were to lay off, it would be better for me, and couldn't hurt any of that change or growth I speak of, but what you do is what you do. Out of my hands, and into yours. All I can do is better myself.

To that end, if you, or any of the other folks I'd say this to if we could sit down and look each other in the eye, and speak from the heart - well, I wouldn't ask anything of you. Not at this point, certainly. But perhaps if you would stand in the way of that change or growth, at some point you'll consider your own motivations, maybe even question them. It happens to almost everyone at some time or other. I know for a long time I almost actively avoided mirrors, vertical ones anyway. Because I abhorred what I saw staring back at me, and couldn't even recognize it anymore. Surely you know I don't mean in the physical sense, of course, but that was in there as well. I'm lucky in my ways. For a person who has put their body through the amount of abuse I have for the number of years, I still look pretty decent externally. Now internally, well, we'll find out soon enough, but that can't be as good, and I'll take that as it comes. My decisions have been my own. But back to your decisions, I hope that when you look into that mirror, you're good with what you see, and think you will remain that way. If not, perhaps some of our shared experiences will foster some growth and change in you, too. 

I realize I have been and can be an asshole. I also know that goes for you as well, and that's cool. I realize that people have been affected by the global pandemic also, just like me, and that it has changed life as we know it. Many found themselves more bored, seeking new sources of entertainment as such. Many felt or were, perhaps are, more isolated and alone than ever before. I know for me personally, the past few months redefined the word alone. If you or anyone else feels any part of the above, you have my sympathy, and empathy. I also know that particularly in the USA, we are in a tumultuous time politically amidst growing civil unrest. Many are rightfully concerned about their future, some are very afraid, and some are very angry at the powers that be or have been for allowing things to sink to the level that they have. I feel the same. Many also are angry and fighting back in the ways they can or lashing out at those that they feel side with or keep those powers in place. I have done my share of that in the past, and my heart is there, too. Although personally I feel that unless all people who are not rich and powerful, mostly born that way, stop bickering amongst ourselves - which only furthers their cause - we are doomed to continue being pushed down and marginalized. Racially, politically, fucking sports teams if you take it that seriously - without finding common ground and extending a hand over the fence, we are divided and easily conquered. I can almost hear Bob Mould. 

You're smart. Yep, you. And I'm teetering on rambling, as I am wont to do. You know what I'm getting at, so I'll shut up. For a minute. ;) If you wanted to hurt me, mission accomplished. If you wanted to kill me, well, you're not the first, and sorry, but I'm not done living just yet. What do I really have, ten years before that massive heart attack drops me, if I'm lucky? Heart disease is on both sides of my family, and none of them have gotten down like I do. A little patience is a virtue. I DID pick up smoking again, for now, and for sure the past few months and my experiences have hastened my death - so, well played. If you suspect that my motives are a ruse, that I'm playing the possum, fair enough, and I deserve that. But you're incorrect. If you, or any others, actually ever had my best interest at heart, well, that's hard for me to believe, especially now, but if I'm incorrect too - thanks. Sorry if I fucked that up if it were that way at one point, and changed. I'm trying, truly, and succeeding, slowly but surely. I expect no reprieve, nor will I ask for one. I do offer apologies and forgiveness, and again, my story won't change. If you took the time to read all this, thanks you, whether it makes a bit of difference or not.I don't remember the night when I tried to end it all. It's a good thing for me cause till a few years back that night was the most vivid memory I had of my entire life. I could remember the exact details of that night down to how the  wind felt on my skin. 
I just want to say I never meant to do it it's just I was not doing ok then. I am sorry that I left that phase of my life midway and I have never been able to tell about it to anyone . I know you are concerned about me and my wellbeing and I feel guilty that I am unable to tell you anything . 
I never meant to dissapoint any one of you . 
I never meant to be the failure I am today . 
Believe me though I won't be a failure for longer I will forge my own path and figure my own life out. 

I still wish I could let this part out to somebody. But it is as it is. Atleast I get to let it out somewhere.i hate you for being right about me. always fucking right, aren’t you? i hate that here i am, shivering in the freezing cold, yearning for a warm embrace but not having anyone to give it to me. 

i ruin everything i have, somehow, someway. i destroy things. i am a being of destruction and i do not know if i will ever become a being of love, of light. 

i want to be good so bad. i do things with the purest intentions and find myself apologizing for the hurt it caused, confused as to how something i thought was good was so, so bad. 

i fear i’m losing the only good thing i have left. i worry if i don’t change soon, she will leave. i worry that i will only grow to hate myself more if i don’t. but i do not know how to change. 

who is going to tell me?I’m reading some things here that sound like the sweet and rational person you were. However I don’t believe you would comfort me like you used to. Not after that text. 

However, I don’t know if that whole thing went down like that because she was in the room with you, or because you really truly want to move on. 

I didn’t even get to read it as closely as I would have liked to because I was busy with something at that moment. It was a really dumb time to send it anyway. I’m so stupid sometimes. 

I had seen you the day before and I just got overwhelmed with emotion. I had so much anxiety over it that I felt like I had to say something. It was only an apology. I’m still lost at what you meant by what you said in reply. 

I’m hurting. I’m trying so hard. I have to go between two modes, which I suppose is fitting if you know anything about me.

One side of me is sad. All the time. 
The other side of me is truly and passionately happy with the life I’ve built. 

These sides are at war with each other and they are both the truth. I long to heal my broken pieces but I can’t do that without a few things from my past being solved. 

I’ve been through a lot of abandonment in my life and it never gets any easier. I don’t think you meant to abandon me. I think you were in the throws of a very deep emotion because of what I had said to you. Truthfully I meant it, and truthfully I didn’t. 

Two sides of me. 

I truly didn’t want to stop. I didn’t want to let you go. But my conscience told me I had to. I still don’t want to let you go. Why am I so attached to you? 

Come back to me please? At least for some clarification? At least so you know what you mean to me.Message received loud and clear. I'm sorry it took so long. I just need to make sure I don’t leave anything unsaid. 

It looks like you’re cutting me off for good. I don’t think I deserve it but I know you’re going through a difficult time. 

I was hoping I could be someone you could lean on to make you laugh and escape things for a while, but you need the space. Just know how special you have been to me. Despite the shit hitting the fan now, I’m glad to have met you. 

I hope you reach out again one day to reconnect when things get better. Never hearing from you again is a really fucking hard pill to swallow. 

But I won't hold my breath.

More than anything, I really hope things get better for you. You deserve everything you want out of life, and I sincerely hope you get it.

Just know if we never speak again, it wasn't my choice. Whatever happens next is entirely up to you. 

Maybe in another life we’ll get the time and place right.For anything. Ever. That's probably a lie. Im drunk and full of flowers, rainbows and sunshine. But never anything trivial. Never anything that NEEDS to be said. Im not a snowflake, love. I can handle it. Please, just be honest with me.So let me start this off by saying I owe you an apology. It's not your standard apology though. I'm not apologizing because I was wrong, but instead I'm apologizing because I just don't care. I don't care what you do or what you don't do. You don't have to do anything you don't want to, or anything that will upset you. You are free to make your own decisions and live with the consequences of those decisions. If you miss out then that is your problem, not mine. And who knows, maybe you're not missing out at all.

All I know is that I want things to continue to be as good as they have been. I don't want anything to complicate that or take that away from me. It's what I've wanted for so long, and I'm so happy to finally have it. You don't know how much it means to feel as close to you as I have in the past couple months. Words can't describe how perfect things have been. I wouldn't trade it for anything in this world. You are my best friend and your happiness is key to my happiness. If you have a problem, you better believe I have one too. You really don't know how much the honesty, love, closeness, and time with me really means to me. I don't want it to ever go away.

Please hear me when I tell you I'm sorry for acting selfishly. You owe me nothing and I shouldn't find my self-worth in such despicable ways. In all honesty it says nothing about how close we are at all. Sex is something you do with everyone, so I must be pretty special if you won't do it with me. I must be better then everyone else to be treated so differently. You must have a reason to single me out and risk hurting me in unimaginable ways for something so silly. But I choose not to let it affect me in that way. I'm going to put a positive spin on it and make it happy, just so I can swallow it and be happy myself. I'm tired of letting your decisions hurt me so much. I don't want it to happen anymore, and I'm not going to fucking let it happen anymore. I choose to make myself better and control my own emotions.

It does suck that you wouldn't listen when I was telling you how I felt and how things affected me. I came right out and said how your actions were hurting me but you acted like you didn't care. You turned everything around on me and made me the bad guy when all I was trying to do was tell you that I was hurting. Well you don't have to worry about that anymore. I'm not hurting and I couldn't be happier with what I've had and what I have.

Thank you for all that you give me and it's more than enough to make me happy. It's the most special thing that I have in my life. Our friendship means more to me than anything, and the value I place on it is absolutely priceless. You are worth more to me then just sex. I want to be your best friend and whatever that entails. I'll always be there for you and I'll always make sure you're taken care of. I'll be the best best friend that I can possibly be so that you can have the best and happiest life you could possibly have.

I truly love you, you know.Your love for me, it was too overwhelming.

I didnt know much about a healthy love love. Nothing, as a matter of fact. 

Your love was true. It was pure and as unconditional as love can get.

That scared the shit out of me. It confused me and made me uncomfortable.

It was too overwhelming. 

I wish I had another chance to grow in love with you.

But we'd both have to be Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Minded, and that could never happen. 

There is no possibilities for us. Too much resentment. Too much sadness and hurt. Too much animosity and baggage. 

Besides, we've both moved on. Myself alone, and you with your new love.

But no one will ever be you.
And no one will ever be me. 

And no one could ever share the connection we had, and really still have to this day. Now we have to keep it under wraps so as not to create hurt feelings. 

I've done enough of that to last you a life time. 

I love you.I’m sorry that I haven’t been honest with you and I never will be. We just don’t have that sort of relationship. No one in our family does and I wish that explained how fucked up I am but it feels like a cop out.

Remember when I dropped out of my dream college and moved to a state I’d never been to? I was depressed and suicidal.
Remember when I was hit by a car and didn’t use my oxy for when it hurt? I can’t remember if I meant to die. I ended up abusing the pills I didn’t use.
Remember when I didn’t call home for forever? I was using cocaine and weed and alcohol to cover up the fact that I tried and failed to kill myself only a few months ago. 

I’m sorry that I could never be your perfect little girl because well, I’m non-binary and queer as hell. I’m sorry that I stopped going to church and I’ll probably never tell you because I don’t want you to feel like you failed at the one thing you were supposed to do with your life: raise good Christian kids.

I’m sorry... but also, I’m done making excuses for the shitty relationships in our family. We should have been better and it seems like such a waste of energy. Idk if this is a goodbye or just a pause on our talking but I can’t bear to be around people that don’t understand me at all. Blood really ought not to mean so much.

FYou said I owed you an apology. So here I go.

I’m sorry that you cannot find it within yourself to channel any energy that isn’t bitter and angry. That any patience, warmth, or compassion you may have had - which I believe you once did - is gone.

I’m sorry that you can’t move on from her - my best friend. I don’t blame you for that. I hope you do, but at the same time, I’m angry.

I’m angry that you think you have the right to mourn. To act like you didn’t give her anything besides your absolute worst for 6 years. You pushed her to her limit with your “venom,” as you so eloquently like to put it, and when she left, you were bewildered. Like it was unfathomable to you that someone whom you insulted, belittled, and used for your own sexual pleasure (don’t deny it - don’t even bother) every day decided that that wasn’t making her happy. Like the way you acted was normal and her wanting to distance herself from you because of it made HER the “toxic” one.

I’m sorry that you’re under the impression that you can just swoop back in every other week and play the “nice guy” role, thinking that she’ll come running back. You gravely underestimate her. She knows her worth, and I do too - I know it better than you ever will.

I don’t understand why you were always mad at her. You were angry when she was sad and a little unresponsive; why didn’t you call her and talk through it with her? You were relentless when you were fighting with her; why didn’t you attempt to find rationality instead of anger? Why were you always determined to win instead of letting yourselves both be happy in the end?

Relationships don’t have winners and losers. There are no “high-horses.” It shouldn’t make you happy to spit cruel words and drive her away; that doesn’t make you a victor. It makes you responsible for driving her away from everyone else, too. Relationships are about mutual growth, adventure, risk, trust, and love. They aren’t competitions of morality and spite. You won nothing. You didn’t lose either. It wasn’t a tie. There was no game in the first place.

You changed her. She doesn’t want to attach herself to anyone anymore. She doesn’t want to have sex because you made her cry whenever she didn’t want to do it with you. She doesn’t want to date anymore because her impression of a relationship is that she will be belittled and pressured and humiliated at every turn.

I worked through my difficulties with her. We were able to have a mature discussion - it wasn’t angry, it wasn’t spiteful, it didn’t digress into chaos. We just talked. Shared feelings, clarified miscommunications, learned, grew, understood each other better, moved on. I know you don’t like that we did, and if I ask one thing from you directly, it’s to please stop using me as a pawn. Don’t mention me to her. I am okay with you not liking me, but please understand that our issues are long resolved. It took 20 minutes. It took kindness, calmness; it took love. 

I’m sorry that you’re not sleeping, but please don’t keep her up until 3 AM to fight with her. Let her rest.

I’m sorry that you’re finding it hard to leave your room, but please don’t be angry with her for going out. Let her explore.

I’m sorry that you’re angry, but please don’t make her see red too. Let her heal.

I’m sorry that you’re having trouble making connections right now, but please don’t be angry with her for finding people, and maybe one day finding love again. Let her love.

I’m sorry that it may be hard to admit, but it’s time to move on. She isn’t fully there either - neither of you are - but let her start. Let her try. 

I’m sorry that the world is gray right now, but maybe she just isn’t your color right now. I hope you find yours.

And when you do, let her go. Maybe you’ll find her again where she’s the waves and you’re the shoreline. Sometimes rougher, sometimes clearer, sometimes rockier - but always there. A part of one another. Always.

And, though highly unlikely, maybe we’ll cross paths again one day. But until then, there’s my apology to you.Someone who can love me fully and express that love genuinely, proudly. Effortlessly.

Tender words, affirmations, and a little romance to make my heart flutter.

Late night conversations about everything or nothing, learning one another and slowly falling in love.

Dancing in the kitchen without a care in the world because in that moment, all is perfect.

Passionate, unbridled sex that makes you yearn, crave to touch and be touched. A connection, chemistry so hot it reaches your very soul.

A best friend to comfort, not hurt, understand, not judge. One who will take on this cruel world's bullshit with me without any reservations.

Fights that end in apologies when needed and euphoric make up sex. 

Sweep me off my feet by showing me your heart and I'll give you my entire world.You were never really a big part of my life. You were someone I occasionally saw or hung out with. We worked together for a little bit, talked from time to time. But a year ago, you did a really shitty thing. You were homeless and you asked me to get you a hotel room for a night because you didn’t have a credit card, they didn’t accept cash, you would pay me back in cash the next day. So I did it. But the next day when we were suppose to meet up, you just ghosted next. I texted you so many times after that, and I never heard from you again. Until today. 

I was so angry with you for so long, but then you popped up on my snap chat and I added you out of curiosity. You told me about how you’ve been 90 days sober now and that you were sorry you weren’t a good person to me the last time you saw me. And for some reason, I forgave you within an instant. Maybe anyone else would have rolled their eyes or wondered “what do you want?” But I just didn’t. 

I want you to know that I’m incredibly happy for you and am so glad you finally got help. I hope you continue to do well my friend and hit me up from time to time.Hi baby. It’s election night and I’m laying in bed and can’t sleep. I wish you were here. I wish I could ask you all my questions about how the election polling really works. I’d be half-serious, half-playful and silly and asking you with nervous laughter and a borderline defensive preface, “well, I know how they work, I just want to double check...” and then have you explain everything to me. 

You were always so knowledgeable when it came to politics, so much more than me. To be honest, I voted differently because of you this time, I voted differently against my party and my entire family and my upbringing. But I think it’s for the better. I just wanted to tell somebody. 

I’m laying in bed missing you. It’s been so long since I’ve seen you. I think I need to go see a therapist. I’m so back and forth on it, but I’m really not over you, and it’s been a while, and every day I struggle not to reach out. I keep waiting to get over you. 

I started working out, I joined a gym, and that’s good, right? I’m closer with my sister than ever before. Did you know I’m finally going to day shift? After being so long on nights. Remember when you’d hold me as I’d cry about being miserable in the dark for weeks? I finally get to have a normal schedule. 

It’s going to be so fucking painful working with your mom, though. I saw her for one of the first times since we both broke up. I had to talk to her. All in a very professional manner, and there was another person in the room, so there wasn’t any chance for an off-subject, quick, meaningful exchange of understanding to pass between us. If that would ever happen, I don’t know. But sitting in front of her, and hearing her talk, hearing your voice in hers, listening to her... fuck, and you look alike too, do you realize? It’s painful. More than I ever want to admit. 

I miss you so fucking much. Fuck, it hurts. I dreamt about you the other morning. I wrote about it, too. I dreamt that I ran into you and I confessed to you and told you that I haven’t stopped thinking about you since the day we broke up. And in the most relieving moment, the strongest sense of relief I’ve felt in so long, you hugged me and told me, “me too.” 

Fuck, you know, I’m sorry that I never responded to your apology text. I didn’t know how, and I didn’t know if it was appropriate for me to, and I procrastinated and got scared. But I’m sorry, too, just for the record. 

I still love you. Can I see you soon? And tell you what’s changed in my life? I finally checked off some things off my to-do list that’ve been there a very long time. I also have developed stronger anxiety than before, I think, but at least I’m independent. At least I’ve made it this far. I’ve grown up. 

Do you know I still love you? I miss you. I miss you so much. I can’t sleep.I want to break up with you. Not because I don’t love you, but because I can’t handle the mental and emotional stress you put me through. You’ve been stringing me along for months and I allowed it because I believed all of the pretty things you said. We want the same things... but I don’t think you actually want those things with me. I just feel like a placeholder if I’m honest. My time and my feelings don’t matter to you because when I call you out for being inconsiderate of those, you go days without acknowledging my existence. As if I’m the wrong one for having my feelings hurt by your actions. 

I don’t want to break up because I don’t want to lose you or the happiness I know we could have... if only you’d communicate more and apologize for recent events. If only you’d seek the help you need for your own problems that I can’t fix, no matter how much I wish I could. I’m fixing mine and trying very hard to be the person you need and deserve.. but I can’t afford to lose myself in the process. I’ve already lost friends for you. I can’t lose me too. 

Please mean the things you say and show me that you really have feelings for me and truly want to be with me... because my heart can’t take much more of this uncertainty.I (M26) was texting you (best friend F26) back and forth as per usual, then I failed to open your last message properly. I clicked the drop down on my home screen and I assumed it would show as read, as it removed the notification.

You say I loose everything, I’d say I misplace things. Ive missed place every important item I own, but they’re usually in a random place in the house and I’ve always found them, Well I misplaced my phone, it died and had fallen behind tv stand, without noticing it had taken me 2 weeks to find. Now most people, yourself included could not go a day without it, but you know me as long as I’ve got a method to listen to music I’m easy going. I tend to use it as an overpriced Walkman with a sat-nav.

So I change my phone an reply back to the missed messages. Out the blue one of our mutual friends (Emma, F27) had attempted reach out to me the previous day. Every now and then we’d catch up and reminisce on the group chat (10 friends from college). But it had been 3 years since we’d messaged, one on one. Then out the blue she asks if I’m good and if I still play this game on mobile? I said I was good and asked how she was, and that I haven’t played the game in years. She left me on read but didn’t think much of it. maybe she was doing a questionnaire for work. However the whole group used to play this game, why was it not ask on the group chat? I continue you go through my notifications, thats when I noticed that I never read your last message. At the same time, I’d seen a funny headline on TV, so I sent you a picture and asked how you are? You didn’t reply, I assumed you were busy and didn’t think much of it.

Just over a week goes by and I’d seen a trailer for a movie we’d plan to see, I sent a quick message and mentioned how I’m surprised that they didn’t push the release date back further, then asked how you were, still no reply. Now the pin finally dropped and I guess you were mad at me. Although you haven’t read my messages, you were online when I sent the last one. Now I’m in the process of writing you an apology and that I will stop bothering you. At the back of mind I have some questions:

Why didn’t you send a follow up message? We shamelessly double, triple and quadruple text each all the time.

Why can’t we talk about this? You taught me that ignoring people isn’t the answer, sometimes things get lost in translation and it’s always best to talk it out so both parties are aware of the problem.

Did you ask Emma to check up on me? I’m finding it odd that she’s text me out the blue, then ignored me when I replied

Have I missed something? I’ve gone through my calendar and it doesn’t appear that I missed and important event.

I guess I’ll never knowI miss everything. I miss our late night conversations, and our daytime conversations. I miss our inside jokes, and our awkward pauses. I miss all the forgotten moments and the what ifs. 

You mean (and meant) more to me than I’ll ever admit, and for that - I apologize. I apologize for not telling you how I felt from the start. I apologize for leading you on. I apologize for not admitting to myself that I knew about your feelings for me before you aired them. I apologize for not responding to you for over a year. 

We’ve always been complicated, and I respect your decision for taking the out. I miss you; and I sincerely hope that you are doing well. 

👾I made a mistake; we shouldn’t be dating. I shouldn’t be in a relationship with anyone. But when confronted with the idea of either dating you or losing you, I couldn’t bear the thought of that second option. It’s not as though I regret it exactly, it’s just that I know this isn’t right. I do love you, but it’s a platonic sort of love. I would gladly do everything in my power to make you happy, and I try, but it never seems to be enough. You want something from me that I cannot give, and that kills me. It would’ve been so much easier to stay friends, but you made it clear that wouldn’t have been possible. I don’t know if I should break up with you, but I know I’ll never be able to go through with it.

I so desperately want you to be happy, but I’m getting more and more frightened every day that this will end in disaster. There are so many people I love and care about in my life, but you seem to want all of my attention and energy for yourself. I try to prioritize you, but it doesn’t feel fair. I don’t think I can ever allow myself to put one person over another in my heart, and I doubt that’s something you’ll ever be able to accept. This is why I try to avoid relationships. But all of this started because I didn’t want to lose you, and that still holds true. This might be slowly tearing me apart, but I see no other option. 

There are things about you that scare me. Your anger, erupting unexpectedly and viciously. Your cynical view of people and your lack of other meaningful relationships in your life. Your silences, heavy with emotions I cannot read. Sometimes it seems you don’t care or even think about me at all, and other times you act as if I am the only thing on your mind. I’m confused and sometimes hurt, but I know you are often as scared of me as I am of you. 

I don’t really know what I’m saying anymore. I think I’m just rambling. This situation has been slowly eating away at me for a long time, and I haven’t opened up to anyone, let alone you, about it. I just needed to write this down, for my sake, to get it out of my head and off my heart. I do love you, and I always will, but I should have kept you as my friend. That way you could have been safe. Things would have been secure and solid and simple. I messed up, and I know you don’t think I did, but I want to apologize anyway. I’m sorry. You are so special to me, and I’ll never abandon you, but I shouldn’t have agreed to date you.So I sent a text not too long ago before I left home. Perhaps you didn't get to read it. I'll repeat it.

I'm grateful that my time on earth has provided me enough patience and kindness to forgive those who have wronged me. I'm glad that I have enough respect for other people and life itself to apologize to them in the face of that, for even though I've been made a spectacle of and ridiculed by and for those who once called themselves my friends, and their friends, true or not, and others - I did and said things that were wrong, and told lies. I'm grateful for the fact that despite beating my brains and body with drugs and alcohol for 25 plus years, that I still look as good as I do. Most don't, and won't. I'm grateful that I survived all of that, and this experience, which absolutely did push me to the brink of suicide. I'm grateful that the day will come, possibly in part due to this, that the day will come when some will realize the gravity of things like that. Hopefully they will make some changes in their changes in their actions and thought processes, and perhaps I will have played a role in that growth. I'm grateful for having enough wisdom to know that most people won't have to experience the death of a child that they care about, and have their family, home, and identity ripped out from underneath them, making it easy for them to laugh at such things. That same wisdom also knows that most of them will come to know the feeling of watching loves get old and physically fail, then die. Some of them will come to know the depths and anguish of severe depression and addiction. A handful of those won't survive it, via suicide, overdose, you name it. Couldn't be me, right? Right. Perhaps those that are left won't find any of these subjects as comical one day.

I'm grateful to know that I'm strong enough to have withstood the invasion of privacy, insults, and psychological manipulation at a very low and weak mental point in my life as I have. I know that many others would not, and if that level of microscope were focused on their lives - what might be found? How would well they deal with it? Especially during a nervous breakdown at what addicts call their bottom, utterly alone during a pandemic? When they couldn't go out and do the things they enjoy, to take their mind off things in the ways they normally would, or meet anyone new - be that friends or romantic interests. I shudder to think, and am grateful that none of them will ever experience that, I don't think. I've said before that what has been called weak and pathetic about me in certain ways will come to be seen differently in the days ahead, if one were to reflect on it. I stand by that, especially for a few of those people. I'm grateful that I know the value of my loyalty, friendship, and love. I'm sorry that at least two others do not. It's a far more precious thing to squander than money, and I do believe that they will come to understand that in time.

In the words of some guy in some book of fairytales written about a god that doesn't exist ultimately designed to keep the masses down and a small few at the top of the pyramid - "Forgive them, Lord. They know not what they do." My own addendum - but some will come to. I asked a certain someone just a while ago - when does it stop being funny? I've asked for no reprieve, don't ask for one now, and expect none. It's fine. But if you've read this far, and I've provided entertainment for you for months now, perhaps consider doing this one small thing for me. I'll never know, and that's fine. It's not about me. It's about you. Try, for just a few minutes, to put yourself in my shoes. This living situation. The few friends, the family, what that situation is like. Trying to get clean in the midst of it all. Trying to remain positive, continuing to apologize and attempting to forgive all. I ask you again - when does it stop being funny? I'm Eric - who are YOU? \*tips hat\*To _______ 

Regrets I have few, except when it comes to you. (Warning long asked post, my apologies) 

I fell in love with you and pushed you as far away as a human could. I did this because I knew you would either scoop me up before I was ready to be in a relationship or you would get angry because I was slow to remove my then ex boyfriend from my house.

He never moved out... and I'm a coward. He never left, and when I nearly lost my mind to depression he was all that was here to help. He loved me through it. Loved me through getting over you. 

That eats at my soul in a way I can not explain. 
Hurts so good.

You who I tried so fucking hard to keep separate from a romantic attachment. 
You who made every inch.of my mind body and soul vibrate. You who were 10 years younger than me but years ahead of me. You who immediately wanted to protect me, but also prey on me. You whose first kiss was a 2 hour moment of passion in an idling car. 

I have a habit of "doing the right things" in that it benefits others and.not myself.  Its not a lack of being able to make decisions or know what I want, because believe me I know what I want (its you). Its that there is more than just me in this picture. It gets complicated and messy. 

And then there is this thought: I was just forbidden fruit to you. But maybe I wasn't.... maybe I fell for you because I lack something within myself.

And that, that statement of "I don't know?" Is what haunts me. Kills me. And made me cry for longer than I've ever cried over anyone. Especially since we never even dated.

But that unknown of how you feel? 

Its why I dream of you still

Its why I still know when you're nearby- because of the tummy flops.

Its why I know i didn't just lust you. I loved every bit of you. 

Its why I'm broken. But I think I broke myself on you. 

I have plans, I will be leaving him again and for good. He is an amazing person, but I can't live loving someone else while with him. If I never met you I would have never known. 

I really did try. To not love you, to stop loving you. 

I stopped painting too, shortly after you last spoke to me... and told me you would never write me again. 

You're done. Rightfully so. 

I'm the fool. -cHey. Im sorry i havent talked to you in so long. Its been a very long time. Im not gonna write much here bc im still annoyed, angry, sad, all of it. Im cringing hardcore bc i know i said some shit. I was defending myself too. Idk why you cant contact me. Idk idk idk. Is it the thousand bad times? Fear of us going through what we did before? Bc ill tell you this. Theres not a soul on this earth worth going through that amount of emotional pain for. There just isnt. 

Anyway, i realized yesterday that me just taking time to reflect, and, hastily and angrily, writing posts on here to let you b know how i was really feeling. Thankfully they didnt send. I was mad. 

As i was saying, its about a lot more than just us. Which, funnily enough, has me thinking about how far ive come. Im dealing with more than just you and i, and obviously youre living your life too, but it gets difficult bc youre more "comfortable" than i am. Im obv decent at what i do or whatever but i still havent figured it all out yet. Barely understand. Rationally, at least. So im dealing with that, dealing with this, i cant stop smoking. Even tho i want to (mostly.......). And dealing with THAT. Is enough on its own. Throw in yours and mine situation and its a fucking dumpster fire. 

I will say this. I did have you on a pedestal. I legit thought so many things and was wrong about 95% of them. I forgot you were a human, just like me. I didnt think my "analysis" of you was entirely... correct. I sensed you were different. But i also was stuck on my past and let that fear cloud my vision kind of. But then you told me your favorite book and rip me bc that was the day u sucked me into ur brain and i had no choice but to flirt back, to love back, to want back. If i knew everything i did now, i still would not go thru it bc it just wouldnt be worth it. 

You know ill always care about you. You know ill always have SOME feelings for you. Im just extremely hurt, is all. I know you are too and i need to apologize for so many things. I like you. A lot. And im gonna take accountability for my part bc even tho i was scared, i didnt have to threaten you.... im so fucked up over this situation jesus christ like what the fuck? 

Anyway,

Been thinkin ab you every second. As always. Our silences never last long anyway. 

Hope ur having a good day. 

❤️I messed up. I know I did. You said you didn't want to pick a fight. I thanked you for that. But in reality I needed you to. It would have knocked the sense I needed to remember why I loved you. Why you loved me. I am mad at myself for how I treated you and made you feel in the end. I'll probably never get the chance to apologize. I'll probably never see you again.

I couldn't talk myself out of leaving. You tried but it didn't work. Maybe we weren't meant to be together. But fuck it still hurts. 

I heard you moved on. That's good. You deserve to. I hope she treats you better than I did. I hope she's everything you need and want. I hope she shows you what love is again. I hope you will want to have children with her and want to marry her the way you wanted that with me. 

I'm not happy. Not right now. I'm not with anyone. In case you wondered. I didn't want to be with anyone. I just needed to finally be alone. I needed that for me. But missing you, getting over you, letting you go is going to be the hardest thing I've ever done in my life. 

Maybe later on life will bring us back together. Maybe in another life I can try again and be better.

Until then....

You were one of the best things that ever happened to me. And I will always love you.I’m really sorry. Why did I do that? I didn’t want to do that, and I hate the consequences. I hate that I can’t fix it. There is nothing I can say to fix it. I can’t ask for another chance, I can’t ask to be forgiven, because I know who I am, I know this is who I am. How can I ask for forgiveness, how can I ask you to want to be around me, to accept that I am a person that does something like this, when you clearly do not want to? 

I will let this go because I have to. I will wait for you to fade from my thoughts, even though this is not what I want. It was not what I wanted at all. I simply have no choice.I’m not sad anymore. I’m not angry. I’ve stopped romanticizing our “relationship”. I got played. When I think of you, it feels like a nightmare. It used to feel like the sweetest dream that I never wanted to wake up from. It felt like home. Now I know I’ve only projected “home” towards you. You weren’t a safe place for me. You had me wrapped up in your games. Two girls at once? You definitely hid it well from both of us. You’ve done this before, I can see it now. The constant apologies for being so busy at work. It was all a lie. The blatant gaslighting when I confronted you. I couldn’t breathe. My reality was so distorted, and I felt like nothing was real. You threw me into the worst anxiety attack I’ve ever gotten in my life. I. Could. Not. Breathe. And posting naked pictures of you and your new girl straight after the confrontation; you’ve crossed the line. Those pictures don’t do anything, but make me feel bad for her. Poor thing, she doesn’t know does she? Those photos are disgusting to look at. You know she doesn’t know that you do this. Sometimes I’d catch myself wondering if the new girl you’re with was entangled in the same timeline as me and the other girl. But then I stop myself from going further. That’s none of my business. You were a nightmare. It took months of therapy, but I can finally breathe again. You’ve played a hell of a game, but a game will always end. I accept the loss, but it wasn’t truly a loss if it brought me more peace now than ever.I want you to know that I’m thinking about you and hoping you are okay during this tumultuous time. 2020 has been a hard year for everyone and I imagine you have felt its effects, too. I think 2020 has been particularly confusing for rule-followers because the rules have been so unclear and constantly changing.  We just want clarity about what we are supposed to be doing and for how long. 

I suspect that, like me you are a rule-follower. You always struck me as kind of vanilla—not in an NSFW way (I have no idea what you are like in the bedroom and I don’t care to speculate) but more in an understanding of, and approach to, life kind of way. It was like you were so used to policing yourself and maintaining a squeaky clean, polite facade that even straying into the most subtle kind of dirty joke or rude language felt a little dangerous (even though every one else does it all the time and much worse). I’m the same way. My language and jokes are so clean that no one really expects me to understand and appreciate the dirty ones (even though I definitely do) and everyone is shocked when I occasionally swear or laugh at what other people say. I just project this image of someone who doesn’t cross that line or only hints at it. But subtly stepping a toe over that line can be fun. 

What makes you a rule-follower? For me, it comes out of a desire for efficiency (following the rules makes things go faster), a little bit of inexperience and naïveté, and a fear of getting called out or yelled at. I have memories of being yelled at or spoken to sternly by adults who weren’t my parents when I was very young and feeling so scared and distressed and embarrassed by it. I guess I started policing my behavior very early on to avoid those experiences. 

Now, when I get into situations where someone might yell at me (especially in my personal life), I either start apologizing and giving in to whatever they want, go completely silent, or try to find a way to escape. 

Is that why you’ve never talked to me directly about any of this? Are you afraid I will yell at you or make it awkward? Or perhaps it isn’t me you fear. Perhaps it is your family? Will you get in trouble if you talk to me? 

One thing I’ve discovered as I’ve struggled through the last few years is, sometimes you have to take the risk of being yelled at. If you don’t, the problems keep festering and growing. Also, some yellers will just keep using your tendency to give in to take advantage and take whatever they want from you. The more you give in, the more they take until they’ve crowded you out of your own decisions, roles, and life. That doesn’t end well for anyone. It’s better to stand up for yourself and push back, especially if you are an equal to the yeller . (Obviously, if it’s your boss,though, they get to overrule you but at least you know they’ve heard and considered your points). 

I hope you know I would never yell at you. I am not a yeller.  Even during uncomfortable conversations, I keep quiet (though I might get nervous or shaky). I also hope you consider talking to me one day. We have so many misunderstandings that need clarification. Also, I’m a pretty great person and you are really missing out by not knowing me ;-).  

And, some day I might have the courage to risk you yelling at me. I might push back on this and plead my case. I’m tired of being meek and this means a lot to me. But, I promise it won’t happen anytime soon. I don’t want to stress you out (and I haven’t the slightest idea how I would even do it). Also, it would be better for everyone if you come to me of your own accord to initiate the conversation. I hope you do someday. 

Until then, I hope you stay well and that things haven’t got you too down. Despite everything,I still worry about your well-being sometimes. I hope you are okay. Take care.I wish I could take back every apology I ever gave you. I see now that I should never have to apologize for the way I'm feeling, let alone the way you were feeling. I shouldn't take the horrible way you treated me and twist it into being my fault, producing yet another apology to spew from my mouth. 

I thought that every time you were having a bad day, it was my responsibility to fix you. It was my job to talk you from the edge. Each time I lost a little bit of myself in the process.

So this is me saying that if I could take it all back and make you acknowledge your mistakes as your own, I would do it in a heartbeat.

Screw you.You were the right person, just at the wrong time.

Now as I watch your life unfold from a distance, I can see how badly I screwed up. You deserve this happiness, away from all the negativity I brought into your life. I know I could have given you this happiness too, if we would have just crossed paths at a different point in time.

The cliches really are true.. Every time you forgave me, I loved you a little more and you loved me a little less. So by the time I loved you the most, you didn't love me at all.I appreciate you for reaching out and caring so much. I’m sorry I don’t respond often and don’t return the same energy. I swear I don’t do it on purpose, life is just becoming hard and I don’t know what to do.

I don’t tell you because I’m seen as the “strong” one and I’m just always aloof. Being alone and dealing with whatever I have by myself is how I’ve always done things. It’s what I’ve grown up doing because those around me never cared and I’m not use to people caring. I just learn to suck it up on my own and to be independent.

I’m sorry if it seems like I don’t want to be friends anymore when I don’t text back. I’m just resetting my brain in order to not respond in a cruel way. If I respond while in my slump, you’re going to hate me more and I don’t know if I can handle that. So I’d prefer you hate me because I don’t respond then hate me for something I said out of emotions.

Don’t let me slip away. Please continue reaching out. I swear I’m trying my best. But if this is draining you, please put yourself first. I’m sorry if what I’m going through has caused you harm. If you can’t handle it anymore, just know that it’s ok and that I won’t be mad. I’m sorry for being a bad friend.
Hi my love

It been the best of times, its been the worst of times. 

No matter what, no matter how hard things have been, always know how much I love you. 

With all my heart. 
With everything I had, at all times. 

Its not been long enough, it never would feel long enough of course, our love, our time, would never feel enough. I know I would always want more. Greedy as that sounds. 

But it feels grossly unfair whilst our children are so young, 6 years in, to what should be a lifetime, or an acceptable length. What that length is I don't know. Till the children are adults? That seems fair, in a life that is not fair. 


I'm so sorry. I never knew this was around the corner. 

I've fought so hard, for almost two years now, you know how hard I've fought, how many specialists I see. 

You, silently, have fought along side me. Quietly, not complaining, taking over the care of the children. Working quietly. Stressing hard. At least you know how hard I've tried to survive, tried, I think, beyond most peoples levels. Trying beyond whatever limits I thought I had. 

My love, this admission is different.

My severe level of immunosuppression has finally shown the results I never wanted to have to tell you. 


Ct changes. Completely different from 3 months ago.

Ground glass opacity. In multiple areas. 

Words I know you have near heard of.

Words that I now know, you will never forget. 

If means that something is infiltrating my lungs. Given what we know is in there, aspergillis nigers and fumigate, and now pseudomonas c. 

We have to seriously think about all possibilities. And we will, together. 

But if you are reading this, then the possibilities have gone. I'm sorry my love. I'm not here anymore. I can't tell you I love you. Wrap my smaller body around you at night, hoping somehow that your fierce life-force will seep through my skin.

We never got the life we wanted. But with my careful planning, you may at least be able to live financially comfortable and not need to sweat the "smaller things". Those smaller things, which aren't actually small. You know what I mean. 


Be careful with money, but not too careful. Meeting the psychological needs now for the kids amd you are far better than waiting. 

Know always that I'd rather be there. Living the life we wanted. Together. All the years with young kids that are endlessly hard, joyful, exhausting, stressful, but so full of love and laughter, tears and triumph. 


Try to enjoy some of this. Watch the girls. I feel they will heal first..... at least appear to. They will do better than Xxx. But they will need help. Let xxxcc and xxx and xxx guide you. 


Even though I can't be there, know how much I love you. Know how much I love all the kids, completely equally. They are 3 different kids, each has different strengths, different needs. I love their differences. Their individuality. 

Irregardless I love you, and all of them. 
With all I have
With every breath 

All of them, as the precious, wanted individuals they are, and the beautiful potential lying within.

Please tell them I never wanted to leave them. I wanted to watch them take their first steps, tie their shoes, start school, finish high school, fall in love, help talk through a broken heart, the first of many is so painful. Drive a car. Go to university. 

Dream, love, explore, adventure. And do so with confidence, emotional intelligence, knowing we are there, any time of day with open arms and open hearts. A kitchen with wine, coffee, tea. But most of all, time. Time to talk through that broken heart, that university score that has now meant their options have changed, time to.talk.and help navigate that first (hopefully minor) car accident. 


XXX, growing strong, trying to be so brave. He will need you. He will act out. You will need to be as patient as you can. Find him supports. Ask his current team for more support. XXX will know who can help. Try keep up his physio, he needs distraction and health. He needs to realise that somehow life moves on, it limps, painfully. However don't push the physical. Its the psychological that will require the most gentle, tender hands. Focus on just getting him and you through this, as best as you both can. And there will be issues, acknowledge this. Be aware. Apologise. 

Remember he is much like me. 


Find a live out nanny. Find a live in nanny. Get them in. Pay a live in agency. Do what you need. Do what you need to ensure you all survive as best as you can. Use the monies I have almost finalised. 


Find a good therapist. For yourself. Go. Allow yourself to feel the anger at the world, at me, ar life, at anything you feel angry at. If I know anything, it's that all feelings are valid. They don't have to make sense.


Denial. Anger. Sadness. Anger. Sadness. Denial. Depression. Loss. Grief so overwhelming that it makes each breath painful. In my experience it all goes around in a circle. There are no clear 5 steps. That's bullshit. There may be 5 well accepted steps, but I feel you can go back and forward and back and forward. 



Grief comes in waves. 

There's a famous saying about this, that I will rewrite as I see fitting. 


That at first they are 1000 metres tall

Relentless, pounding, knocking you down and coming so fast you can barely have time to get to your knees before the next one comes.

With only tiny breaks between

During this time you may feel you just want to lie down. Die. Drown in the tsunami. 

But if you can, I hope you can go on. 
You say that I am strong, but you are far stronger than me in different ways. 
Your survival instinct is excellent. 

Every time these waves come you have to find a way to pick yourself up, work out where/what you are facing, and assess the damages.

However, slowly, so slowly, that you may not even notice it at first, they lessen. 

Occasionally there may be one thats overwhelming, where you feel like you may keel over from the pain, where sucking in each breath hurts so much you worry about chest pain. 

Get that checked, ask for an ECG. 

But slowly, over time, the other waves, will not be as tall, nor hit as hard.
Not bring you to your knees, or leave you in a dangerous ocean rip.

50 metres

20 metres

10 metres

They will knock you, but not quite as hard. 


The big ones will keep happening, occasionally, they may drop to 1x month or less. They will knock you off your feet, they will bring you to your knees, they will make you want to cry and yell to the world, "Why". "Why me? Why you?"

But they happen less. Eventually. 
Do trust me, my love. 


And then over time 

You will find yourself turning, wanting to say something to me

A joke, a news article. 

And I won't be there.

Not in person. 

To kiss you goodnight, hug you in your sleep. 

I know, together our family unit felt complete. 

And there will be a hole. 
A hole, exactly the size of me, inside. 
Please work on that, when you are ready. Perhaps recognise that I fought as hard as my body could medically take. 
Perhaps in time, look at my medical notes. 
See how hard everyone tried 


I will be there, as much as I can be.
I will live on, whilst I'm remembered. 

I'm so sorry. I can't do more.

Be more

Live more


All the things I'll miss, break my heart. 

Our sensitive boy,  whose heart is going to be shattered, like a crystal glass dropped 100m. Hopefully not beyond repair. 

Our 3 year old girl, so happy, caring and loving, who adores her entire family. 

(All her birthday presents are ordered/bought. There is nothing for you to organise. A cake. A few friends. Just 2 maybe.)

Our precious wanted toddler who smiles with her entire face, and laughs with her entire body. I hope, in a way, she forgets me. Although be aware that will cause issues later. I feel she will be jealous the other two knew me. Please don't let her blame herself. Its an unknown. She is wanted and loved. I have the family I dreamt of.

I feel.so blessed to have you all.
You, my precious, loving supportive husband. 
My darling eldest boy who is so much like me. And my two girls, close in age, who adore each other. 


Why I fell apart, I don't know?

At most, I should have ended up with asthma. 


Who knows where everyone else has come from?

As it stands, I'm in acute care, awaiting palliative care to come and talk to me. 

I can cry, as I'm alone. 
I'm afraid my love 
For us all. 


All my love, now and forever  

And my darling.
Please consider dating again. Don't give up on the idea. They won't be me, but that's not bad. 
You are too young, too full of life to be alone. I don't want that. I cannot make the decision for you, but know it is not what I want. For you, for the family.I know you’re hurting. I know you know I’m hurting.

I often get frustrated and think, why can’t it just be simple? Why can’t we just help each other not hurt? 

But it’s never that simple, is it? 

I wish it were. 

I wish one day we could just approach each other and say hey, the past has sucked. Let’s learn from it and make the most of today, for a better tomorrow.You’re my lofi songs I hit on repeat, the cup of coffee that I sip, soft rain pouring on the roof, my name out your mouth feels like a soft caress.

You’re also the songs that I skip, coffee gone cold I don’t wanna sip, you’re thunderstorms and heavy rains— babe you take me so high and you bring me so low.

I want you so bad and I know you want me too. Are we too much for each other? Maybe I found what I was looking for, but I think I wasn’t meant to keep you.

But, babe? Can I keep you?
Be my lofi songs, my cup of coffee and soft pouring rain. And even when you’re not, I’ll never skip, I’ll sip you even when you’re cold and I’ll stand through your storm.

Let me heal your wounds, even those I haven’t caused. Let me put your pieces back and keep them together with my embrace. All I ask if for you to do the same, when I fall apart and make mistakes.

I never tried very hard in life,
I promise I’ll try my hardest to keep you, if you let me in one more time.

I’m sorry.I obviously made a throwaway for this, even though i'm sure you'll never see it. But thats not going to stop me.

I honestly don't know what to say, I've thought really hard for a while now and I'm simply at a loss of words. But I do know I love you, more than anyone I have ever loved. Sure, I love my family and my friends, but I have never experienced loving someone else as much as I love you. I keep thinking about the relationship and what it means, but I just can't figure it out. But maybe thats just it. Not everything is black and white, and I'm still learning that. But our relationship is too complex to define. Just like the Invisibles. It's everything and nothing all at the same time. It's the best, but the worst thing to think in my opinion. But the thought of not knowing scares me a lot. So I just keep hoping that in the next 476 days I'll figure it out. But I know I won't. I probably won't until my next lifetime to be honest. I thought I was okay with your absence, but today I broke down I guess. Cried for hours, and I'm not entirely sure what caused it. It just happened. My heart really hurts, but it hurt when you were here too. I don't know why or how I could love someone that makes me feel so inadequate, but I do. Theres something special about you, and I am damned determined to figure it out. I'm sorry i've messed everything up, and I'm sorry I wasn't enough when I was there. But I'm not sorry for knowing you, and I'm really not sorry for loving so much about you!  A wise man once told me that "we're supposed to miss the ones we love when they're gone. It's how you know they mattered." and I've been holding onto that very tightly because its the only thing keeping me here in the moment.

 I love you, and I'm sorry.💚The more time we spend apart, the more I realize how messed up our relationship was. We absolutely loved each other to death, but we never knew how to express that love in healthy ways. We were obsessive, controlling, and insecure. But we were soulmates. I've never felt such a strong connection or love like that before, and I still have yet to find another quite like it. I loved you with all my heart, and I'm so sorry I was to immature to handle it. I'm sorry I made every wrong mistake and treated you so poorly. I'm so sorry I was stubborn and selfish and unkind. I'm sorry we weren't good for each other at the right times. I would give anything to go back in time and fix it. I would hold you and tell you everything's going to be okay. I would love you and care for you and support you like I should have. I would communicate with you and give you space when you need it and be the love of your life that you deserve. I wish I knew back then the things I know now. It hurts so much to move on, and I think a part of me never will. I will never experience such a ride or die passion for anybody else. I will never be able to get close to anybody else like that ever again. I'm so sorry we ended up like this. I'm so sorry I caused you so much pain. I'm so sorry for everything I've done to you. I'm so sorry a piece of our hearts will always be stuck with one another. I'm so sorryI miss how soft and gentle you could be, your heart was home and I didnt know it till I had none. You gave me all the warmth you had and left none for yourself I think.

I drained you of your love, it was unfair. I manipulated and molded you into an image that I created. You realized that with me you couldnt be whole....

I want you to love yourself as much as I had convinced myself that I had loved you. Theres a contradiction in my heart where I feel empty without you in my life, but also a happiness that I'm not hurting you any further.

I was a stone tied to your ankles and you were drowning, you survived me. I'm still sitting at the bottom of the lake, as a stone I dont swim, nor do I drown. I just linger here at the bottom, looking up at you as you swim away.

And now.... you're out of sight, but never out of mind. I'm sorry that I only learned how to love you once you leftI made a mistake; we shouldn’t be dating. I shouldn’t be in a relationship with anyone. But when confronted with the idea of either dating you or losing you, I couldn’t bear the thought of that second option. It’s not as though I regret it exactly, it’s just that I know this isn’t right. I do love you, but it’s a platonic sort of love. I would gladly do everything in my power to make you happy, and I try, but it never seems to be enough. You want something from me that I cannot give, and that kills me. It would’ve been so much easier to stay friends, but you made it clear that wouldn’t have been possible. I don’t know if I should break up with you, but I know I’ll never be able to go through with it.

I so desperately want you to be happy, but I’m getting more and more frightened every day that this will end in disaster. There are so many people I love and care about in my life, but you seem to want all of my attention and energy for yourself. I try to prioritize you, but it doesn’t feel fair. I don’t think I can ever allow myself to put one person over another in my heart, and I doubt that’s something you’ll ever be able to accept. This is why I try to avoid relationships. But all of this started because I didn’t want to lose you, and that still holds true. This might be slowly tearing me apart, but I see no other option. 

There are things about you that scare me. Your anger, erupting unexpectedly and viciously. Your cynical view of people and your lack of other meaningful relationships in your life. Your silences, heavy with emotions I cannot read. Sometimes it seems you don’t care or even think about me at all, and other times you act as if I am the only thing on your mind. I’m confused and sometimes hurt, but I know you are often as scared of me as I am of you. 

I don’t really know what I’m saying anymore. I think I’m just rambling. This situation has been slowly eating away at me for a long time, and I haven’t opened up to anyone, let alone you, about it. I just needed to write this down, for my sake, to get it out of my head and off my heart. I do love you, and I always will, but I should have kept you as my friend. That way you could have been safe. Things would have been secure and solid and simple. I messed up, and I know you don’t think I did, but I want to apologize anyway. I’m sorry. You are so special to me, and I’ll never abandon you, but I shouldn’t have agreed to date you.I know you’re going through a lot right now, and I understand, I really do. I want to be there for you if you’d let me, but I know you probably have someone else to vent to, so I won’t message anymore. I just hope you know that I’m also here to listen and arms to hold you.I genuinely can't express in words how breathtaking you are. You're the nicest person I've ever met, you're funny, you're compassionate, you're smart, you're perfect. I want to be with you so badly, but then I remember I'm a mess. My psychosis drags me down everyday, so does the OCD, PTSD, everything really. You deserve someone who's stable mentally, not me. I learned to put my heartache to the side, but it comes around again sometimes and it feels horrible to know I'll watch you fall in love with someone else.





I'll carry on though, you'll still be my best friend. I'll stay by your side until the day I die if I'm able to. Sadly I don't know if be able to stay by your side long then. I feel like dying. I just feel like curling up and passing on peacefully.




Just know that I'll love you no matter what. And that I'm always here for you.I'm sorry mom. You deserved a life for yourself. I know I may seem distant, but the truth is I love you more than anything. You deserve happiness, but I was what ruined and chance of that happening. I've had a rough live because of you, and saw so many things I wish I never did, but I feel more disgusted with myself than anything. Because you deserved better, and having me took that away from you. You're a horrible, hateful, person today, but it wasn't always that way. I listened to you tell stories about how you used to donate to women's shelters, help people out, and were understanding of people different than you, and you say your regret it all, that nobody was there when you were struggling, so you don't care about anyone else anymore. I understand I was the reason you went through so much troubles, and I was nothing but burden for you, and I ruined what was once a smart, kind, cool woman. I'm sorry for taking your life away. If I could never have been born, and you could finally live your life for yourself, I would do it everytime.I’m sorry. It never should’ve happened this way but it did. In truth this is the last time I’ll apologize to you for existing. It’s not my fault that you put no effort into our friendship. You drove me to be pushy because I was under the impression that this relationship was necessary to my survival. That was my first and most fatal mistake. What was I to you anyway? Just something to pass the time until you could move along? I guess that’s what everyone is to everyone but even still, it’s not fair. At least if doesn’t feel fair. All of the time and effort we both used to put in. It was a lot of fun but it was hard to maintain, like any friendship. I just wish you had told me straight out. Said you didn’t want to be friends or you didn’t have the time. I could have respected that. But you broke me. And I’m not apologizing for that anymore. It’s your turn, and I’m not waiting anymore.I can feel you distancing yourself from me. You say it doesn't hurt but I have been in your shoes, I know how much it hurts. It's unbearable at times. Whenever we talked, a fire ignited in my heart and butterflies filled my stomach. I did what I had to or else you'd have ended up being hurt and that is the last thing I want to do. You are so fucking precious to me. I'm sorry. I can hear it in your voice, I can see it in your eyes - you are hurting and I feel so helpless that I can't do anything to help you. Hurting you is the last thing I wanted to do yet I did it. You have been through enough already. Maybe I should just leave because you don't deserve someone making your life worse. I love you. I do. In such a short time, you made me feel like the most special person in the world. I don't deserve it. I don't. I'm selfish so letting you go is going to be hard. But love should be selfless right? Your happiness is the reason for my happiness. You'll be happier without me. We both say 'I love you' but we mean it differently... that's what I made you think. And you believed me. Maybe I'm not so bad at lying after all. 

                      Forever yours,
                            
                   Stupid little loverI do not know if you remember that I post on here or get on here at all. 

Here’s a list of things I’m sorry for:

1. I am sorry for falling in love with you at the wrong time

2. I’m sorry for not telling you I needed to leave sooner

3. I’m sorry for not knowing the right things to say or when to say them or how to say them 

4. I’m sorry for just fucking everything up 

5. I’m sorry I didn’t explain out everything I was feeling right away 

6. I’m so sorry for hurting you in any way ever. I know leaving hurt you and I’m so fucking sorry. If there was an option where I didn’t need to do that, I would’ve chosen that option. I truly do feel like I needed to do that for myself. 

A list of things I’m grateful for:

1. Getting the chance to love you. I think if the circumstances were different, I could have ended up marrying you.

2. I’m glad that I told you the truth as soon as I knew it, even if it hurt you. You deserve to know that.wish that I wasn't such an asshole, that i could of just simply enjoyed your wonderful presence.

you were/are the kindest, sweetest, hottest person that i have ever been lucky enough to spend time with.

i am simply fucked on the inside, couldn't stop myself from still talking to other people, not from anything you did, totally a behavior coming from my own shit feelings on myself.

Will always wish that I would of just stopped and understood that all the love i could ever hope for was right next to me.

am sorry, will always be sorry and will miss you always and still love you even with all my shit behavior.

i hope that you find happiness, either with someone who truly sees you for the wonderful person you are, inside and out or with yourself.

sorry hotmess, forever sorryDear X,

I’m sorry. Now that I think about it, I might’ve been too harsh in rejecting you and probably hurt your feelings really badly. You asked twice and I said no twice, and now I am thinking about it I think you mustered up a lot of courage to invite me. 

I’m fully expecting you to let it go and never invite me again since I was so harsh. I deserve that. You avoided me the rest of the day today. I was expecting to have a conversation as per our usual, but I blew it. I know that now. 

I’m sorry that I may have hurt your feelings. I truly thought it was a game or a joke we were playing. I’m sorry I never cleared it up with you. I should’ve used all my communication tools with you had I been able to think. Every interaction with you puts me in the moment and suddenly I can’t think anymore.

I still love you and care for you. I will be here if you decide you still want to talk to me. 

Love, meHey lol.

I think you’re a really neat person and I vibe with you hard but the truth is I am just weird as shit irl. I hope you don’t take it personally that I upped and dropped off the face of the earth.

Anyway. I don’t even know if you liked having me around. I never know with people lol. But I leave things anyways because that’s just what I do. 

I guess it could have been easy to stick around but I’m a different guy than I used to be. Shit has happened and I’ve been down paths I’d rather not have been down. Followed rabbit holes that lead nowhere, this being nobody’s fault but my own for being misguided.

Anyway. The point is I like you as a human being. I think you’re good. My vanishing has nothing to do with you and everything to do with my own personal bullshit.

Maybe I’ll get through it one day. Maybe.

Ah but who knows. Maybe I’ll just keep meeting people like you and screwing up by cutting them off out of fear of disappointing myself.

Ugh. Me, me, me. That’s all I talk about. I guess what I really did was help you dodge a bullet by leaving.

But hey. I guess what I’m realizing is that I can be better than this. I can be more than a stupid paranoid jerk and recognize that when people say good things about me, they actually aren’t being sarcastic sometimes.

My dumb ass is just sitting here thinking that people are out to get me 24/7.

I wonder what it’s actually like to stick around and give people a chance. There’s a part of my brain that screams at me whenever I try to do this in the slightest, but would it really be that bad? 

I’ve been an asshole for years and convinced people I don’t care about them just to save my own skin. It’s the same damn routine every time. You’re not the first.

But maybe I’ll make you the last.

Maybe actually acknowledging when I enjoy the feeling of being and interacting with a person... isn’t utter stupidity. Maybe my presence isn’t as reprehensible and vile as I tend to think it is. Maybe when I like something, it’s actually possible that it truly is right and I’m not just delusional and corrupt for thinking that it could be mutual.

Anyway I am so glad that you will never ever see this letter in your life. I promise I’ll become better from this because I honestly liked you and you remind me of other people I liked in the past... but let fade away into nothing in my perception.

You truly are a kind person. Being around you and simply talking to you was a pleasant experience. You’re good.

You’re good and I’m so sorry.No matter how badly you wish for her, she is gone. She is not coming back. 

No matter how many nights you spend desperately wishing to wake up on a day two years ago next to her, and realize it was all just a terrible dream, it will never happen. It wasn't a dream. It was life.

No matter how many years you spend maintaining everything of hers just as she left it, she still won't be there.

You can spend the rest of your life trying to find some way to bring her back. She will still be gone, and you will have spent your life trying to relive something that is lost forever.

She was so proud of you. She told us once that one thing she loved about you was how unbreakable you are. No matter what life threw at you, she always knew you would come back swinging. Dig down, and try and find some of that now. Make her proud again.I feel terrible for breaking us up. I'm torn apart by my head, knowing it was time, and my heart that just wants to feel love again. I miss feeling overwhelming love for you and from you. I don't know why my feelings change, and if I could will them to come back, I would. 

I crave your conversation, but I know that I can't do that to you. I can't lead you on, give you false hope, and let you think things will work out the way you want them to. I won't do that to you. So many people have been tormented by indecisive exes, and while I see the appeal, I care too much about you to do that to you. It's kind of cruel, how breaking your heart and making your worst fears come true is exactly what I'm supposed to do if I care about you. 

I started having dreams about you again. I always have dreams I remember, and part of how I knew I loved you was that you were always there, even as a cameo. In the months leading up the the breakup, you weren't there anymore. I didn't miss you when we were apart, and I didn't get excited on my way to you. How awful to only feel these things again now that were apart. This choice was my last resort, and it was supposed to make me feel better. It was supposed to make the voice in my head that called me a liar when I said that I love you to shut up. 

The relief came eventually. I still think I made the right choice. But this longing aches. It doesn't hurt like it did at first. I don't feel like I'm being split open. I feel like I have a dull bruise, aching in my heart. I know that it will heal with time, but it's almost worse this way. It's not enough to make me cry or get angry anymore. It's just…there, and it feels like there's nothing I can do about it. 

I think of you a lot. I miss what we had, but I know we can't get it back. I don't want to abandon you entirely, but I've been told that the only way to make sure you move on is total radio silence. I should have told you and given you a chance to fight like you wanted to, but I know the end result would've been the same. I'm sorry for not giving you that chance. 

I hope that you're taken care of by friends, family, and the therapist I think you should start seeing. I used to think you hating me would be the death of me, but I know now that I would welcome it. Anything to help you get over me, someone you put on a pedestal and thought was perfect. 

Your perception of me was never quite right, and I know now I shouldn't date someone who sees me like that. It wasn't healthy for either of us. You always blamed yourself. You're doing it now. But there's nothing to blame. My feelings have changed. I wish they hadn't, but I can't do anything about it. I've tried for months. You showed me what it feels like to be in love, to be loved, and how it feels to love without being in love. 

I'll miss you. We'll figure out where to go from here eventually, but until then, let's leave it at this.I am such a disappointment to this family, I can't even do tests right. I am so sad even though all you have done is been good to me and I don't wanna bother you so I just say I am fine. I am not fine. I am so fucking lonely and sad. I wanna be okay, can you tell me how to be okay? Because it hurts. It hurts so bad. I can't even cry anymore I just feel awful and I want to cry. But I can't because I have made these rules for myself because I can't do anything right. I am so so sorry. Im is sorry for being such a letdown. I am sorry for not caring. I am sorry for wasting all my time. I am sorry for not being good enough. I am sorry for being so sad. I wish I could go back in time and be a better person. But I cant . So I live in regret. I don't wanna die but I don't wanna live like this either..... So I am sorry.You don't have good boundaries, so you don't even realize how rude I was, or how badly I messed up. I can't just say that it was wrong that I let us become close friends because that is confusing and you aren't responsible for that. I do not want to overwhelm you with my guilt but it's not like I am walking around like normal after hurting your feelings like I did. I haven't been able to do homework, eat, or talk to my friends. I am filled with remorse, and I hope you don't think that I wanted any of this to happen. I really, really messed up. And there's not much else I can do about it. I want to delete all of my social media and just forget any of this ever happened but that would be running away from it. I am trying really hard to take this head on. I am scared to send my apology note to you. I am scared that you want revenge. But please understand that I am trying to make things right. My morals have finally returned to me and it is horrifying and it is freaking me out and I wish I wasnt dealing with this alone. I'm so sorry.I’m sorry I was just 14. I’m sorry I didn’t fight harder. Im sorry I didn’t breast feed you in the hospital. The nurse said it would mess up  the bond with your real parents. I’m sorry I forgot to bring the blanket I made you and now it sits in my house a memory of childhood lost and you. 

I’m sorry I’m selfish. I’m sorry I’m a failure. I couldn’t even graduate college. I’m nothing to look up too. Your better off without me but it hurts every day. I can’t breathe. I miss you every day. I love you every day. I can’t hold my friends children because it reminds me of when they took you out of my arms. I wish I could have kept you. I really do. But I’m a failure. And you are better off. 

I love you more than life itself.I have been thinking about writing this letter for the longest time and it is also under contest by my better sense. (Due to the fact, I didn’t want to rehash old wounds.) I’m sorry how I broke such an amazing girl like you—I was scared and unaware of how to love and care for you, as much as you did for me. I remember the night that I ‘ghosted’ you instead of telling you my feelings of fear. The next day I felt sick to my stomach and every other day I still think about you—two years later. I remember how you used to always talk about the future of us together, but now I just watch you blossom and enjoy your life from the sidelines. I envy your boyfriend and wished I was there—but in the end we all have to lay in the bed we make for ourselves. Here’s the kicker to this whole thing, almost a year later I was diagnosed with heart disease. Isn’t that ironic? I broke yours, now mine is breaking. I wish I could take all the pain away that I brought you—I’m a horrible person that is eternally sorry.Fuck you for making me feel like a placeholder.
Fuck you for every lie you've ever lied.
Fuck you for the gaslighting.
Fuck you for every time you cheated.
Fuck you for messaging other women while I slept next to you in "our" bed.
Fuck you for making me feel like I'll never be enough.
Fuck you for never owning up to how insecure you've made me.
Fuck you for making me question reality.
Fuck you for taking away the only thing I ever considered "home."

Thank you for helping me realize I can get through any motherfuxking thing.
Thank you for doing such a bad job hiding your infidelity.
Thank you for showing me I deserve better.
Thank you for ma.
Thank you for the fond memories.
Thank you for the adventures. 
Thank you for telling me that love is real.
Thank you for showing me you, along with me, dont really know what love is.
Thank you for teaching me to never love a boy more than he loves you.

I'm sorry for not loving you the way you needed to be loved.
I'm sorry for making you feel inferior, ever.
I'm sorry for all the insecurities.
I'm sorry for the last fight.
I'm sorry for always doubting you.
I'm sorry for all the pressure that was put on you.
I'm sorry for anytime I wasn't there for you.
I'm sorry for not being the one.
I'm sorry for always wondering if I should have left.I am sorry for the things I've said. I'm so sorry for disappointing you and pushing you away. I wish I could take back all the things that I've said but I couldn't. I have already hurted you. I want to make things right. I want to msg you and call you so badly but I don't have the guts to do it cos I'm the problem. I caused the fights and I just didn't want to bother you or cause you anymore hurt. I didn't one to be one of those girls that have hurted you. You know from the beginning, I just want you to be happy. I really just want to make you happy. But I don't know how, I'm so terrible at it.

I've always felt so insecure in losing you cos I don't seem to know how to make you happy. That someone else could come along and she could do all those things that I couldn't. This is the reason why I lost you. Because of my insecurites, I pushed you away. 

I'm sorry if I seemed to ghost you, I didn't want to but I felt the need to just go away to give you space, to give you peace. But don't think that I'm not hurting or that I don't care. Cos I'll always care. And I'll always need you. 

I hope someday, we will be okay again.

I miss you so much! Alot! I hope you're doing well ❤️It might be to late for this but I'm sorry,  I wasn't always there for you and I treated you poorly sometimes. 

You were always so kind,  you were so fun,  childish,  creative,  funny,  (smart but you always hated when someone called you smart) and loads more. Just basically the perfect ideal person. 

Now why the hell did I screw this up?  I actively knew I was screwing everything up.  But I didn't stop, why?  Because I enjoyed the fights,  it was always easier to live in misery than be happy. 

Again I'm so sorry,  maybe I shouldn't even be around you anymore.  I was never any good for you. 

There's so much more I want to tell you but I can't as yet. 


So Alice please forgive my stupidityI should have just been honest,And not a coward about what has happened.To be honest I used the excuses of the what if’s with your feelings and what they probably weren’t to talk myself out of just spitting out what I had to say.I’m sorry if I wasted more time,And maybe I’m not.I figured it would be better to leave you in the dark,For the “Just in cases”,And the other drama.

It was a lot of fun mostly,And I am stupid sorry that I chose to keep dragging my situation out.For what it’s worth,I got the shit end of the stick,And have to live with my shit choices every day. Even if you didn’t give a shit about me,I feel slightly relieved I feel bad,It actually means that I am still alive and have learned from some of my mistakes. But regardless of my guilt or situation ,I won’t love my little boy any less. Idk ,Maybe you dodged another one of my dramatic bullets.

I hope at least you got the message ,And that I feel better finally opening up about what’s going on,I would have felt like shit if I didn’t even give you a distant heads up.i don’t know why i broke up with you. well. i broke up with you because i fell out of love. or maybe i just never actually loved you in the first place. i’m not sure. but either way i’m so sorry. i don’t even know what to think anymore. i’m so lost. i’ve been depressed for a while. never told you. well, until i broke up with you. i couldn’t handle it any longer. i knew i stopped feeling when i could no longer fall asleep in your arms. i would just lay there, staring at your wall with you sleeping peacefully next to me. thinking thoughts that weren’t about you. it was torture. i love you. but i wasn’t in love. i feel like it came out of nowhere for you. for me it was a slow crumble. i could see the walls falling down all around me, while i just watched. maybe if i cared enough i would have tried to fix things. i probably should have. but i’d been losing myself too. i don’t know who i am anymore. or what i want. or where i’m going. i needed to let you go. i felt trapped. still do, but at least now i know i’m not pulling you down with me. i told you i’d be with you forever. so i’m sorry. you deserved better. i hope you’re doing okay.You probably don’t remember that morning; for you, it was the start of a day like any other. Mom was making lunches in the kitchen, Dad had barely woken up, and we were preparing to head to school. You were grumpy and sassy like always and I was quiet and sleepy. For you and everyone else in the house, that chilly October morning was completely normal.

But for me, it was the end of the world. 

Not for the first time in those past few months, I had woken up to a feeling of absolute nothingness. But the nothingness felt different than it had before; it was a void of feeling so thick that I could barely hear the world starting around me. The rustling of clothes, the clanking of dishes, and the jingling of keys were all deafeningly quiet. My vision felt like one of those old films where they had so few frames per second. I barely registered the feeling of moving out into the early morning air before time suddenly skipped and I was sitting in the driver’s seat going 75 miles per hour on the expressway. How did I get here? I couldn’t remember.

It was at this point that the voice in my head began to speak. Normally, it was easy to drown out, but the nothingness that surrounded me provided no protection. I couldn’t stop myself from hearing it:

*You’re so useless.*
*What’s the point of trying if you’re just going to fail anyway?*
*Everyone hates you. You’re unloveable.*
*The world would be better off without you.*
**Why don’t you just kill yourself?**

I was so tired of feeling this way: weak and helpless and alone. This voice in my head and the void that accompanied it broke me down. I should’ve been stronger; I should’ve fought harder; I should’ve resisted, but I didn’t.

I figured it would be a quick death; nobody would survive crashing at such a high speed. To avoid a collision with anyone else, I decided to just drive off the right side of the road and go into the ditch separating us from the farm fields beyond. I wouldn’t have to worry about killing someone else that way.

It was only a few seconds, but everything felt so slow. I took in a deep breath and then instinctively turned my head to the right. Back then, I was still a new driver, so it only felt natural to look where I was turning even when it wasn’t really necessary.

But I’m so glad I did because I saw **you**. 

Your arm was propped gently against the windowsill and you were looking pensively out the window. And you had your earbuds in—you never liked the music on the radio. The sunrise seemed to be creeping up just behind you. It was an angelic sight; the first thing I was truly able to see that morning. 

Slowly, I turned my gaze back to road ahead. My vision was quickly becoming blurry, but I didn’t care. I could only focus on one thing:

**I had almost killed you.**

Because of my fucked up brain, I had forgotten you were in the car with me and I almost killed the one and only sister I am ever going to have. I felt like the most disgusting being in the universe. 

It’s been a few years since the incident. The first time I told anyone was at college; I broke out crying one day with a couple of my friends in the dorm room and the words just tumbled out of me. About a month after that, I wrote a whole English paper about the experience and shared my “personal monster” with the entire class. Then, over the summer, mom found out while we were alone in the car; I don’t think she’s realized you were there with me.

Since I’ve started opening up to people about this experience, I’ve been trying to find a way to tell you. But I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to share my darkest secret with the person that’s known me our whole lives. I know that you would never forgive me if I told you; I will never forgive myself. How could I ever expect you to forgive me when it was your life that was in jeopardy?

If you were curious, I’ve never felt the urge to die again as strongly as I did in that moment. I think the guilt of what could’ve happened has kept a lot of those intense feelings at bay. Perhaps there is one positive that has come from all of this; it doesn’t make what happened any better.

*I’m Sorry.*

Sincerely,
Your Big Sister
I admit. I had the biggest crush on you for about 2 years. I daydreamed about you nearly everyday for two years. Remember when you said ur birthday wish was to go star gazing with someone. The truth is whenever I went star gazing I thought of you. I wondered what it’d be like to let myself fall completely in love with u. To laugh, to hug, to kiss, to cry with you. To use the entirety of my mind, soul, and body to love you. But ur gone now. And I was the one to leave, but I wish you gave me time to explain. I didn’t leave because you were depressed or not enough like how you feared urself to be. I left because it hurt to repress 2 years worth of dreams. I wish u would have left me room to tell you how much I love you and still do. Are you okay? It hurts knowing that I’ve added to ur pain. I wish I didn’t like u this way. Only then, I could have stayed with you. Please please tell me ur here. If u want u can hate me. Please don’t hate urself. I’m sorry. I’m sorry. :(I know that I'm the last person you thought would be texting you tonight and I'm sorry I didnt make myself more clear When we last spoke. I know it had seemed like I never wanted to speak to you again, and you would be right to think that. I had no intention of ever talking with you again or ever seeing you out of my own volition, I was done, or at least I thought I was. 

I was trying to move on, trying to get myself out of my rut and just find another soul to connect with. I didn't want much and I was far from moving fast, but at every turn I felt myself drift. I would lose focus and it would all come back to you, the way you laughed or the way you said something, it all kept pointing towards you.

I couldn't see myself with someone else because I always saw you in them, I would always remember what we had and feel like I was doing something wrong showing them the love that I showed you. I was a fool of my own emotions and let too many people get hurt because I loved you.

I have always loved you, I've loved you since the day we met, I know we were young but I felt a connection that let me know we would be bonded for life. That bond is what makes this all so hard for me, I know deep within my heart that one day we will cross paths, it is fated between us and we both know it will happen

Five more years, ten, twenty, how many years until we fall in love, just to be broken apart. Will it be when one of us is married with kids, or when we both are so broken we only have eachother. I hate this back and forth of heartache, I just want it to stop.

I don't want the old us, I don't want a new, I dont want somebody else that reminds me of you. The reason I'm saying all of this is because I never want to say it again, I never wanted to say it to begin with, but ill say it now. 

I love you, but I never want to see you again, for the sake of us, the future us that will be happy with someone else one day, living life to its fullest. I want them to be as happy as we tried to be. I'm sorry that things didnt work out but its time, and for good this time, that we say goodbye. 

You are my all in all, my everything
My one true love, my evergreen

GoodbyeI don't know how to say what I need to say but I'll try my best because I need to get it off of my chest. And hopefully this will help you in a way. 

I'm sorry. I never meant to hurt you or make you feel the way you do now. I never meant to try to control you or do anything like that. I'm sorry for not being good at communicating and I'm sorry it is talking me so long to trust. I'll get to each point but I need you to know that I never meant for any of that. All I want is for us to be happy, for YOU to be happy. 

I'm sorry I hurt you or made you feel how you're feeling right now. That was never my intention. I love you from the bottom of my heart and more and I would never want to hurt you. It kills me to think that I'm the reason you're a mess right now. I'm so sorry I failed at making you smile. 

I'm sorry I tried controlling you. That is something I have been trying really hard to work on, and I failed. I'm trying so hard to let you have your freedom just like you give me mine, and that starts with me not being controlling. So I'm going to work even harder because I realize you need freedom to do the things you want to do, I just need to learn to go with the flow and give that to you. 

I'm sorry I struggle with communication. I try really hard to be good at it but it is so difficult to when I never want to ruin what we have. I am so scared that if I communicate it will lead to us breaking up and that is something I never want. I'm working on communicating and being better about telling you when things are wrong, I just struggle and now is one of those times. I'm so sorry it is making us this way. 

And most of all I'm sorry it is taking me so long to trust. I know that is the biggest think needed in a relationship and I swear on my life that I am almost there. I just have small setbacks and this time it became a big setback. I'm so sorry and I never meant for it to happen. I'm working so hard on trusting and I've never actually trusted a guy as much as I trust you. But I'm not going to let that be enough I'm going to keep working on my trust until I can confidently say to you that you have all of my trust. 

So I just want you to know all of that. And please know that I'm hurting too. I know I could live without you but the thing is I don't want to. When I'm with you I feel more alive, more wanted, and a better version of me. This time with you has been magical and we have has so many ups that I know is who we are. This is just a little hiccup, I know that because I truly believe that you are my soulmate that my grandfather lead me to. I don't want to give you space anymore but if that is truly what you need, and you don't want to talk then I'll do my best. I'm not very good at it though because there are so many things that I want to tell you throughout my day. But I'll do my best just please don't wait too long. I'm slowly falling apart without talking to you because you are my best friend, you're my person. So just remember how much I love you and that I am constantly falling more in l love with you everyday regardless of what we go through. I miss you handsome. I hope you see this... so please call me soon...I just needed a friend and I thought that was clear after repeating it many times. I told you after that first argument that it would be best if I just kept being alone because it is what I'm used to anyways. I'm sorry for waisting your time. I'll miss you a lot.I am so hopelessly bound in your orbit that most of the time I can’t even express the half of what you mean to me. I love you. I love you so much it is an ache that I will never relive myself from. 

 I know you don’t share in my feelings, and you love me more than anyone should love her best friend. I’m sorry that sometimes it somehow isn’t enough for me. I regret allowing my own feelings to get in the way of your relationship with him, even though it burns me from the inside out.

I understand i might seem a little mellow-dramatic, but everyone else who has found themselves hopelessly in love with you will testify for me. (I will never admit that it is in my nature to be dramatic, no matter how much you pester me about it)

I feel so guilty for loving you,  but at the same time I refuse to let it go, however much heartache it causes me. I am enamored by every part of you. I love you for what you like about yourself as well as what you despise. I will love you tomorrow, and the day after that, and when I am just a pinpoint in your memory, a girl you think about rarely, if at all. 

You’re oblivious to my feelings and thats fine. But I hope that one day you find this letter, and add it to your favorite memories of all time.I don’t know if this letter will ever find you. I don’t know if I will ever send it. I don’t want to upset you or mess up your healing. 

I’m sorry. 

I’m sorry I’m so damaged.

I’m sorry I’m so angry.

I’m sorry I’m so self destructive.

I’m sorry I hate myself so much. 

I pushed you away because I was scared. I was scared you would leave me or betray me. I pushed you away because I felt undeserving of your love. I never thought I was enough for you. I always just wanted to be enough.

I’m sorry I lashed out on you.

I know you were trying to make me feel like I was enough. I know you were trying to fix the distrust. I never would have felt like I was enough for you because I didn’t feel like I was enough for myself. I was clingy and dependent on you because I was terrified of losing you. 

You are my favorite person and we had a connection that can’t be compared. I know I ended up pushing you away anyways. You are so special to me and I just wanted to keep you in my life as long as I could. I’m sorry I made it so short. I wish we could have had a longer story. 

Thank you for ending it. You did what I couldn’t. I never wanted to treat you less than you deserve and you deserve great things. It’s okay if you don’t have any fight left in you.

I’m still so excited for your future even if I’m not in it. You are so smart and kind and you attract everyone around you. I know you will do great things and live a happy life. It will be my biggest regret that I won’t be able to explore life with you and see you grow. 

I’ve always wanted to die young. As I got older I just pushed the age back more and more. For the first time, being with you made me want to live a long life. I wanted to grow into old ladies together like how you said. I wanted to travel the world with you. Thank you for making me excited about the future. One day I suppose I will accept that you no longer want to be in it with me.

I’m sorry I let myself get so toxic and cruel to you. I’m sorry I ruined our relationship with the emotional and verbal abuse. I’m sorry I pushed you to a point where you didn’t recognize yourself. I don’t want to turn into how my Dad was when I was young. I refuse to become my Dad or Mom in regards to how they treat their partners. I refuse to become an alcoholic and lose my passions. There is so much I locked away and never dealt with from my childhood. I was really a lonely kid and didn’t get the attention I needed from either of my parents. I think this has made me extra dependent and cling to my romantic partners. It made me endlessly search for that confirmation and reassurance from you and it never would have been enough. 

It’s no excuse regardless. There was no excuse how I started to treat you. Even if you lied and made me more insecure it was never okay or just. I need you to know none of it was your fault. It’s my own issues with myself. There’s nothing you need to change about yourself. Just be honest with people. People will accept you for you and accept you completely. It’s okay if you’re still figuring yourself out. We all are. We are young it’s okay. 

It sucks that human nature is sometimes to display the same behaviors and become the toxic person that hurt us in our childhood or past relationships. I won’t become my abusive dad I fucking swear on that. I wish I wasn’t so stubborn. I wish I was going to therapy when we met. I’m sorry it took me so long. I have a lot of pent up anger at the world and I’m sorry for just now learning how to cope with it in a healthy way. I own up to all my wrongs and everything I ever said to tear you down. I wish I could take it all away. I can’t. All I can say is I’m sorry. I hope you don’t resent me but I don’t blame you if you do. I’m sorry I disappointed you so much. You couldn’t fix me even if you wanted to. I have to deal with my issues alone and fix myself. I will make the best version of myself.

Please take care of yourself. If you ever need me you know where to find me. I’ll always have a shoulder for you to lean on. I want to be in your life but I want you to be happy more. I respect your decision and won’t contact you again. I just wanted to say sorry. You have my entire heart and you will always have part of it. I love you so so much and I’m sorry I didn’t know how to show it. I can’t wait to get to know you and fall in love with you again whether that be in this life or the next. Be safe and take care of yourself angel. Don’t settle and know your worth because you are absolute perfection. I want you to get everything you want out of life. Live a happy, fulfilling long life my love.

Y, thank you for loving me even when I didn’t love myself. I promise my love was real for you I just needed to heal. Our connection was the realest thing I’ve ever felt in my 22 years on this planet. I love you infinitely.

-AThis is hard. I'm going to change, I promise.

If I would have known how bad it was I wouldn't have brought you into my life at all. I thought I was getting better and I thought it was enough to say that things had happened but they were in the past and I was over it all. It made me feel proud when you told me I seemed healthy.

I don't know how to tell you. The words won't come out even if I fucking try and I don't want you to feel upset.

I'm fucking sorry, honey. I don't want to lose you or cause you pain.Those are the two things I want to know. You're all I can think about. I've tried to distract my mind, but this Covid situation has gotten in the way of my usual outlets. This whole mess has robbed me of sleep, productivity, I cry all.the.time. All the time. It's really hard to get through the day sometimes, and I just want to know that you're sorry and if it matters to you that you hurt me so bad.I'm Sorry I didn't speak to you today. I just knew it would end up in me feeling like an asshole like usual.

Just know I don't harbor any resentment towards you. I just cant allow myself to be vulnerable around you anymore, Because I know if I do ill end up worse than beforeDear Claire, 

I am sorry it took so long for me to write. There's been a lot going on and it's been taking forever to get everything I needed to say together.

First, I would like to say that I'm sorry. I'm sorry for wasting all of the gifts you gave me, and I wanted to thank you for everything. It's nobody's fault but my own. I apologize for starting back drinking when you were the reason I quit after drinking for so long.

I'm sorry. 

You were the first person that knew I drank because I had problems instead of looking at me like I had problems because I drank. 

Thank you.

I saw your son a couple of months ago. He's getting so big. It's crazy to think that he was only a few months old when I first saw him. 

I wanted to thank you for the way you treated me when I first met you. I could tell you were getting impatient the first night we ever spoke. I had you send three different videos of yourself verifying you were actually who you said you were. I could tell by your patience that you had experience with people that suffer from anxiety problems. 

Thank you.

I will be in town in a few weeks. I wanted to come to see my brother before I leave. And I have a surprise for your son. It will be several years before he will be old enough to drive it but I figured it is the least I can do. Do you remember when I showed you the satellite picture of my favorite spot on Earth? I cannot believe that you knew exactly where that was out of over three hundred and fifty miles of shoreline. People like us are rare. 

When you first met me, I could tell by the kindness in your voice that you grew up as I did. The reason you were so patient with me is that you didn't want to look like a disappointment. Somebody I once cared about said they grew up like that as well. I really hope that they were lying. I wouldn't want anybody to have to deal with that kind of guilt. 

I wanted to apologize for what I said the last time that we spoke. I told you that the reason I didn't move down there was that I didn't care about you. And I told you that I didn't want to have to be responsible for your son. 

That was a lie. I'm so sorry. 

The truth is that I would rather you have hated me for not caring than hated me because I ended up hurting you or being a bad father to your son. I was a coward. 

I went to your Facebook page last August to message you and apologize but when it loaded I saw your mom's post from two days before telling all your friends that you had gotten a blood clot that had lodged your lung and that you had died. I'm sorry that I was a coward, and that I didn't go with you. I could have at least tried to make the last few months of your life happier. 

I'm sorry for wasting everything you gave me. 

I wrote a short about us, and I remembered how you always laughed because I always referred to us as being old. 

You were the one that introduced me to this sub so I figured it was the best place to leave my last letter to you. My last letter to anyone. I know it took me a long time to write to you. It's been a rough year. And honestly, I needed you with me. I wasn't ready to say goodbye yet. I wasn't ready to let go. 

I am now.

Bye, Claire. I Love You. 

See you soon.

# The Old Man by David Cousins

# Monday.

The old man stared at his coffee cup. The coffee had stopped steaming long ago.

He started to raise his arm to look at his watch.

He stopped. He didn’t care what time it was. He had nowhere he had to be.

The chain on the ceiling fan made clanking sounds, tapping on the uncovered light bulb as it swung in a circle.

The old man rubbed his chin and stared at the cup. He shook his head slowly.

He missed his friend.

He thought about days he would go fishing. His best friend was more than happy to ride along.

It had been a year since he had been fishing.

Fishing sounded so relaxing. He wondered what the weather would be like tomorrow. 

# Tuesday.

Rain.

Sheets of rain.

Thunder.

Sadness.

# Wednesday.

The old man looked at his watch. One hour and he would get to see his friend again.

The seconds crawled.

The old man had shaved. He wore his best clothes.

He paced.

A knock.

His ride had shown up. He locked the door on his way out.

The ride took forever.

When he walked in, his friend didn’t come to meet him.

He walked slowly to where his best friend waited.

He was happy to see his wife. His best friend.

He took a small box from his pocket and opened it.

Tears welled up in his eyes.

He sat the box next to her. Inside was a locket with their picture. She didn’t smile.

He kissed her hand. It was cold. He said goodbye and took a seat and waited for the service to start.

He looked at his watch. It was time.I'm sorry I was childish and selfish the attention you gave me made me really happy and your friendship and the way you see the world the way you speak and think fascinated me and I was afraid you would disapere . And by my actions I made exactly that happen i miss you so much i miss our late night talks and the way you made me look at myself ugly as it is becouse it makes me want to be better I'm sorry if I lead you on it wasant my intent I was looking for a friend and we had such an intence connection a conversation deeper than sex ever has been and I never anticipated that and I didn't know how to handle it I wish I had done everything differently and then I panick babbled and made you think I thought you were the kind of person you would never be becouse you have a wonderful heart I wish I could have known what you taught me before I met you so I could have done better . I will always think of you .I miss you. So much. It’s been almost a year but I still can’t believe that you’re gone. You were always there. You’d call me often but now you’re gone. It doesn’t feel real to me. I’m sorry. I’m sorry for the things I’ve said in the past. I’m sorry that I wasn’t a very good grandson. I was young and stupid, I’ve been trying to forgive myself but it’s hard. I wish I could go back in time and apologize to you. I wish I had spent more time with you. Why did you have to be gone too soon? I wanted you to see me accomplish things. I wanted to help you and buy you stuff. It hurts so much. I love you and I miss you.Hey there, man! College has been rough, and I think moving halfway across the country strengthened the feeling. But it can't be as hard as what you're going through, and I just wanted to say that I'm sorry (first for the title, and second for what's I'm going to say).

I can't think of one time where I wanted supported you as much as I do now, but I can't think of a worse time. To hear that you have a brain tumor, while only being in middle school, is heart-stopping. I can't express how much my mood sank after hearing the news. What makes my heart wrench is how I heard the news a week after the doctors had already taken it out. I'm sorry that I wasn't able to support you then, and every other time I wasn't there for you.

In my eyes, I think I always saw you as a toddler, waddling around grandma and grandpa's house without a care in the world. I guess I never thought of you as a person, vulnerable to all the problems outside, and the hardships everyone else goes through. You're a kid that's twice as smart than I was and 3 times as athletic. You're like a spaceship that's flying further and further into the great unknown, and I couldn't be more proud. However, I should have known that there was more going on underneath, and I'm sorry for not talking to you sooner. You always gave me the feeling that there was hope in the world, even if it was from a person as close to my age as you, and I can't see why it should stop now.

To sum it all up, I'm here for you, little cousin. Reach the stars and shine twice as bright. Keep on fighting. I want you to go further than any of us ever could have. And keep laughing, cause if you don't, you'd better bet the "Tickle Monster" will be there to make you!For being the quiet guy who never says much. I hate that it makes me seem creepy when all I want to do is get out of this shell. For always forgetting to ask how you are when you clearly make it a point to ask about me. For just freezing up in y’all’s convos or saying dumb shit. Mostly I’m sorry for trying to come across as someone with their shit together because I am literally an autistic mess (literally in this case meaning in a literal sense, on the autism spectrum). I can’t relate to most conversations. Relationships? I have none. Job? I’m on disability. Politics? I could care less. It’s all normie talk to me. I guess what I’m trying to say is I’ll do my best but don’t take it the wrong way if I can’t relate, M. I’m not trying to be the creep.I had hope for the first time in a long time. I feel like I’ve grown so much since we met but I crossed a boundary I didn’t know was there. I understand why it has to end but I really wish it didn’t. I wish you would give me a chance to show you that I think you’re worth it. But I have too much going on and didn’t mean to get this deep to begin with. Maybe this is for the best but my days without you have been so bleak. I don’t want to know what the next few weeks will look like. I know I’ll meet my match one day I just kinda hoped it was you. Thank you for telling me where I fucked up because I can work on growth in that area just to improve myself as a human. I’m really going to miss you.You're kind of the perfect guy and it intimidates me. You do way too much and I feel like I'm never doing enough. You're so beautiful and how you think makes my heart flutter over and over again. I'm wondering all the time what you see in me, because I know it's not my looks. It's also not my confidence. I'm funny sometimes, but that can't be it. So what is it? I don't dare ask you.

Yesterday you joked if I ever considered a career as a politician, because I am great at avoiding and not answering questions. In all honesty, I just find it very hard to say that I like you. I form a sentence in my head and I never say it, because it doesn't feel natural. I grew up never expressing my positive feelings with words, however, *please understand*, when I hold your hand, when I stare into your eyes for minutes, when I smile, I'm trying to tell you everything that you somehow manage to express with your words.

I hope you hear me.Sorry for being such a jealous person and sometimes making you feel sad. I can't control it. I know I'm such a pain in the ass most of the time and I'm sorry for that. I hope you can forgive me.There are locked rooms deep inside my head and if you press your ear to the door and breathe really quietly, you can hear what we used to have. Those memories are something I will always cherish in my heart. Thank you for that experience, it has made me who I am today. 

I’m sorry ClerissaI want to thank you. 

I know it's strange to say something like that, after all that we went through, but I can't think of any other way to put it. You were my first real relationship, and everything I thought I wanted. You were smart, and a leader. You loved trucks and sports cars. You loved being outside, and you were always planning something in the summer. You were my best friend. 

And yet, I wasn't happy. I wanted more. I wanted something different than what you gave me. I wanted to go to new places, and see new things. In the beginning, everything Was new. I was new to the area, and I got explore so much with you, but then it wasn't new anymore. 

I want you to know that our breakup wasn't only your fault. Yes, we had our problems, but the biggest one stood in our face from day one; I wanted to travel, and you wanted to build a life together, to stay put. 

Thanks to you, I have a better understanding of myself, and what I want in my life. I thought I wanted kids, to settle down in a tiny house, with a big yard. I thought you could be my rock, the one that would hold me down, keep my thoughts and dreams realistic, and that I would be happy. 

But I wasn't. 

I know now that my core need is to travel. I can't simply be held down for a domestic life, it's not what I'm made for. I've realized this, and I've accepted that I may never find love. And that's okay. I am happiest when I am on the trail, or exploring somewhere new, or meeting new people. That's not something I could do with you. Not to the extent that I wanted.

I want you to be happy. I know that you said you were happy with me, but I wasn't. You deserve someone who can be just as happy with you as you are with them. You deserve someone who appreciates your truck, just as much, if not more, than me. 

I can't send this to you. I can't let you know that I still think about you, that I still love you. I'm sorry it was so jarring when I left. I tried to make it as easy as possible on you, but your mother fucked that up. I know you had little to no warning (though you knew you were on your second chance). I thought it would be easier for you if I just dissapeared from your life. I tried to wean you off of me by working non-stop. It's not like you were paying attention when I was home, either. I knew you wouldn't want to see me again once we broke up, so I tried to get all my stuff out first. Then you wouldn't have to go through it with me, and keep seeing me packing up my stuff. 

I thought cutting you off would be easier on you; out of sight, out of mind, so to speak. You weren't letting me go,  and I thought that would help. 

I'm sorry for breaking your heart. For a long time, I thought I was going to marry you too. I thought we'd have such a happy life together. 

I want you to know that I am happy now. Living alone in my own apartment is wonderful. I have so many herbs, and I'm hiking as often as my schedule allows (still struggling with a regular cleaning schedule though). 

Please, let me go. Be patient, and let somebody new come to you. I know how much you hate being alone, but please, please be patient. Take this time to learn to be happy and comfortable with yourself. The right girl will come along. 

I love you. I miss you. You will always be a part of me. I want you to be happy without me. Good luck in everything. 

Goodbye.It’s not that I don’t want to tell you anything it’s just I don’t know how to explain it. I’m generally a happy person, but I have this feeling of loneliness and sadness all the time and sometimes the happiness is fake and I don’t realize I’m faking it till I get home and I know I’m alone. That’s when I feel like this pit feeling in heart and all I have the strength to do is crawl into bed. And when I lay in bed the feeling of loneliness is overwhelming, like I can be surrounded by people and I’ll feel like I’m the only one in the room. All I can really do is just let myself feel like that and cry it out, but that just makes me feel even more like shit because I feel so weak and pathetic. And you don’t have to tell me I’m the only person in the world that feels like that, because I know! But it doesn’t stop me from just feeling like shit. I don’t know how to explain why or what causes this, it just happens and I’m sorry if you feel like I’m pushing you away. Its not that I can’t talk to you or don’t trust you, and I see you as a friend so of course I would talk to you about anything. It’s just I don’t want you to worry about me. I’m so sorry I make you feel like you’re not a trusted friend when in reality you are the world to me. I’m sorry that I can’t just open my mouth and tell you everything I’m feeling. I’m sorry that you feel like I’m a better friend than you are because of my inability to express myself to you. I’m sorry.I know I’m years late to this party and this is a bit out of the blue, but I wanted to take a second and apologize to you for basically.. all of the things, but mainly my many missteps when we were together. 

I was unkind with you a lot during that time and I’m so sorry if I ever made you feel that way. I took advantage of you at that time and I hate knowing I did that to you. I regret it terribly and I apologize. 

I’m sorry I lashed out at you when you had the strength to call me out for and raising your concern about my substance use. That would’ve taken incredible courage, and I know you were asking out of kindness. Thank you for your kindness. 

I’m sorry I wasn’t my best for you. You deserve much better. I’m immensely grateful that, despite this, you were the first person I got to genuinely love. I wish I could do it over again, I’d do it so much differently.I understand that you’ll never feel the same. I understand that will never be the way I wanted us to be. But even so, I am sorry. I’m still in love with you. Through  it all, even after leaving him with you. After hoping that you two can satisfy each other. I am still in love with you.It’s been a long time. Almost two years? Yeah. November will make it two. 
I think about you every single day. Longing, regret, anger, acceptance, grief. Mostly regret. I feel like I go through all the stages of grief every day. I wake up with a burning aching hole in my chest every early afternoon. I sleep when I’m sad. You know that too well.

I want to talk to you, I want to tell you how sorry I am and how much I want you back in my life. I took every single thing you did for me for granted. I wasn’t patient, I wasn’t understanding to you and your problems because all I could ever see was myself. I’m selfish, I probably always will be. But losing you is a hard lesson. 

It’s my atonement. I have to watch you go through life getting over me, finding new love, exceeding in your goals, and hopefully, one day I get to see you be happy. Even if it’s not with me. Even though it hurts and hangs over my heart like clouds beneath the sun. I won’t reach out to you. I don’t deserve to have that. I’ll keep watching you from afar with my never ending adoration, knowing it’s what I had and gave up. I deserve this. I deserve every choking sob that the shower head thankfully keeps muted. 

I regret this. I regret everything. 

I’m so sorry, H.I'm so sorry you had to witness how bad my depression is. I didn't want any of that and I hope you'll forget now that I deleted the messages. I miss you so much even though it hasn't been a week. But I can't tell if you miss me. I know we were too dependent on each other which is why I won't move back till next year and won't share a room with you. I want to spend time together having fun and not being anxious whether you want me there or not. I want to take things slow this time and not rush but it's hard to not want to talk or spend time with you. I feel like you could easily move on with life without me. I can't stop overthinking and assuming the worst and I know I shouldn't. I shouldn't put you in a box of you're already done with me, otherwise why would you still talk to me? Why would you have agreed to a date this weekend. You're the one who even called it that. I want to be better, to not think like this. Hell I'll even go on antidepressants if that would get it to stop my brain thinking like this. I usually give up easily because trying after 17 years feels pointless, but I don't want that anymore. I want to get better so we can start over and have fun together. There's so much I want to do together but if I stay like this we will only end up how we were. Arguing and hurting each other. Hopefully tomorrow will be better than today.I didn’t want to be like this, and you don’t deserve what I did to you. I lead you on, even when I knew it wouldn’t happen. I know we are still friends, but I still feel terrible for how I made you feel and how I did it. If I could go back and redo, I would make it easier for you, and I wouldn’t have waited so long. I’m sorry. I hope you understand that I really truly thought that I meant what I said. Just because I didn’t doesn’t mean I hate you though. I was very confused, and honestly still am. Despite the fact that you will never hear this or read this. I am sorry.

Sincerely, someone who made some mistakesI’m sorry I lied to you. I’m sorry I told you everything would be better soon and that we would figure things out. I still love you. I still think about you all the time. I’m sorry I panicked. I’m sorry I wasn’t strong enough to push through the fear. I understand if you hate me for it.I'm sorry I'll never be enough. I'm sorry I hurt you. I'm sorry I got too close, and I have the potential to hurt you. I'm sorry I lied to you. But I can't do this to you. I can't be yours when I can't even be my own. I love you now, and I love you forever.I feel really good with you. Maybe even happy, I don't know. Normally, I'm more aggressive, more assertive, more vulgar. I've been told it's part of my charm. But with you, I feel pathetic, but in a good way. Like I don't have to act the way I normally do to be secure, like I can just let go in a sense. It's really nice, sure, but I'm not used to it. I have no idea what to say to you without tripping over myself. So thanks, I guess, and sorry.On the surface everything looked perfect. Our friends and family admired us constantly. After a string of bad and abusive relationships it was *so pleasing* to me to hear the people we love telling us that we were their relationship goals. We hardly ever disagreed, and if we did it was even more rare that we’d actually fight about it. I think we’ve had a legitimate argument maybe twice in the 5 years we were together. 

We both listened to the other respectfully when talking issues out. But part of the reason is that we are both terrified of conflict—we seek to avoid it no matter what. That would cause me to flee if my emotions became too strong in a discussion. I’d turn around and walk out wordlessly, because if I opened my mouth I knew I would say something cruel I didn’t mean. Or at least.... I knew I wouldn’t mean the next day. And your fear would cause you to change your mind and just agree with me, because that was easier than standing your ground. 

The sex was frequent and *very good*. Our friends, hearing that we would have sex 3-5x a week even though we’ve been together 5 years, were amazed. Again on the surface it looked perfect. But my libido is much lower; I would prefer 2-3x a week and you settled for 3-5 knowing you would prefer 3x *a day*. Even if we had that much sex in a day, the first thing you would say to me is “can’t we go again?”. I am not able to satisfy you. Isn’t that why you turned to porn over and over and hid it from me? Lied to my face? I tried to be more sensitive to your sexual needs. Maybe if I just did it enough with you, you wouldn’t feel the need to go behind my back with porn. Or at least, maybe not so often. After the last porn incident, I still had sex with you. But it got harder and harder to look at you and be attracted. I still loved you. But the chemistry started to evaporate. 

People were so impressed that we spent so much time together! Especially when we were both at home for months. I’d spend 8-10 hours by your side. Because that’s what you wanted. That’s what made you happy. But I couldn’t do my own things. If you wanted to watch a movie, I couldn’t sit beside you and knit or read a book. You needed me to be engaged in the movie *with* you. For the first few years of our relationship, I played my video games maybe only an hour a day, or I’d spend one day a week playing and the rest with you. My relationship with my long term gaming friends suffered for our love. I started to feel smothered at some point last year. It wasn’t too bad, it was still doable. I started to spend an extra hour on my computer. Then two. 

I wasn’t a perfect partner, but I did make sure I spent an equal amount (or more time with you) with you as I did with my own hobbies. If I wanted 4 hours of gaming on my day off, I would spend 6-7 hours going out and doing things with you first. But that wasn’t enough for you. And you hate all of my hobbies, so I couldn’t bring you with me. I always had to come to yours. The smothered feeling increased until I felt like I couldn’t breathe next to you. I still loved you, but being near you started to hurt. 

The truth of it was that butterflies wasn’t something I experienced with you. When we first started dating, I was nervous and unsure. Low self esteem from being abused for so long. I learned a new way to love with you. I thought that butterflies were perhaps juvenile and that a good and stable relationship could replace them. And maybe it can. I don’t think I need butterflies. But I think I gave them to you. I think you’ve always loved me just a little bit more. 

I’m sorry it took me this long to realize. I’m sorry it took me this long to consider that you deserve someone who doesn’t feel smothered by you. You deserve someone who wants you to interrupt their wake up routine, who doesn’t feel like your presence in the morning when she’s drinking her coffee is an invasion. You deserve someone who is as excited about you as you are her. 

You may not realize it yet. I know you’re hurting so much. And I love you so, and I regret hurting you like this. I know you don’t care that we aren’t compatible. I know right now more than anything you just wish I would take you back. Sometimes I want that. This week has been so hard without you. Sleeping in a different bed without the sound of your breaths to lull me back to comfort and safety after a nightmare is so alien to me. I wake up disoriented without you. 

But when I broke up with you, we both cried. I cried harder, actually. The pain on your face tore me in two. 

But underneath my pain I felt *relief*. Like ripping off a bandaid that needed to come off a while ago. 

I’m so sorry it took me so long to realize. I’m so sorry I have to hurt you like this now. I’m so sorry that we weren’t the perfect couple everyone thought we were. But I can’t prioritize you over me anymore. I love you, but I am not in love with you. You deserve someone who is in love with you, you deserve someone who wants you back. I never meant to fall out of love with you. I never meant for us to end like this. We were supposed to get married and travel and live happily ever after. 

God I will miss you. I know you better than the back of my hand. I know what you will say in any situation, and nothing you do will ever surprise me. I know everything about your body. About your sense of humor, and the kind of man you are. We were not *perfect* the way our friends thought we were. But we had 5 good, long years of happiness together. We really did. I just hope that you can look back on them and smile when you’re healed. I just hope that I have ended things as courteously and as gently as I could, so that you don’t have baggage in your next relationship. 

I’m sorry I had to break up with you. I’m sorry I couldn’t tell you all the reasons why. All I could really say is that the reasons don’t matter, because there’s nothing that can be done to fix them. We just are not compatible and I can feel it in my gut that this relationship isn’t right for me. 

I will miss you so much it hurts. I will love you for the rest of my life. 

I just can’t be with you anymore.I'm sorry I couldn't solve my problems in time. I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you when you needed because I had something going on in my mind that wouldn't let me. I can't find words to say how much I miss you iven if its been just a few days. I tried my best but I took too long and I know it, I understand that you are hurt, that you need your space and that we still have a chance, but that little time you asked me feels like an eternity, every second I miss your hug so much that it hurts. You are the love of my life and I fucked up. Everytime I remember how many mistakes I've made and how few you did, I start to cry like I've never did before. I don't know if you can love me again, but if there is one chance, I'll do my best, I owe you that. I'd do anything for your hug right now. I'm sorry.Im overwhelmed and hurt rn. Im tired of this shit. Im so incredibly disappointed and i feel dumb as fuck for actually thinking you "loved" me for me. According to what ive been hearing, i need to get the fuck away from you bc youre using me for whatever i can do with my "skills". Idk whats true, bc its pretty convincing. It feels way too real and theres something out there that really doesnt want me to be with you. I cant unsee what i saw and heard. Its disgusting. Talk of respecting my boundaries yet still seeing lowkey violent shit. Not respecting that im going through it trying to keep it together and you repeatedly seem to always find a way to break me down. I will never get over what i saw the other day. What i heard. Its sick. I cant unsee it even though id love to push it down. Sick as fuck. Go find someone else. 

At least ill get over YOU eventually, like i was.

Im not stupid, my intuition is screaming at me to run. Youre abusive. Youre mean. You dont care. All shit literally everyone keeps telling me. I dont wanna hear it anymore. Its not worth it and to continuously feel deep hatred but then getting my hopes up that shit will change. Maybe im not in the right place to be with anyone. Maybe this shit is legit over and we both move on. Its toxic as fuck and im just like not feeling having that in my life anymore. 

I thankfully have people in my life who will support me and help me get through this. I cant keep dealing with this for a woman who keeps moving the goal posts. Im literally not fucking with this anymore. I dont care. I just dont. I have to keep myself safe and idk if i can find that with you after everything. You fucking hurt me bro. And i keep coming back. Idk. Im good w this sub"I'm not right without you..as much as I try to be strong I just ain't".

"I need my serenity".

"My soul n center is gone".

That's what you say to me.

My old self used to crave those words. I wanted to hear them said to me. I wanted to be someone's everything..take up every ounce of them..consume them..because if I was in the forefront of their mind..they'd never leave me. I'd have them forever and we would be inseparable. Previous me would have been so jealous of my current relationship. I'm finally someone's everything. I'm finally what they need and depend on to make it through the day.

Man, ignorants is truly bliss..because I didn't know what I was asking for. This kind of love and dependency isn't romantic..not in the slightest. What I thought I was missing in previous relationships turned out to be something that hurts a relationship. I used to be so angry I wasn't their everything. Was I not worth it to them? Was I not their sun, moon, and stars? I should have been who they lived for, because we loved each other. It was within my right to occupy as much space in their minds as necessary. 

How selfish is that? I was expecting them to take on my insecurities, my feelings of worthlessness, and make it all better. If they couldn't do it..or weren't up for the task..obviously they didn't love me..right?

Unfortunately, it took me being on the receiving end to realize how constricting and selfish this mindset is. Love isn't binding yourself so tightly to someone that neither of you can move. 

But, how do I tell you this? How can I speak to those parts of you that are traumatized and broken? I know you aren't trying to manipulate me..you're just scared and insecure. But, these beasts and demons...you have to help me fight. I'm more than willing to go to war for you..but I can't do this alone. I tried..and I'm growing so tired.It’s not easy for me like you think it is. And often, I wonder if it was a mistake. This is the longest we’ve been apart in 4 years. But this year has been the most difficult one so far. Things are pretty bad for me mentally right now. And they are for you too. I just need some time. I’m starting therapy next week. I think that might help. I wish I could make you understand. 

You told me that you don’t think you’ll hold my hand again. But you will, only if you want. You told me that you don’t believe it’s temporary. But it is in my mind. I won’t ask you to wait for me though. That would be selfish of me. I know you found my Reddit, so maybe you’ll see this somehow. 

I love you so much. I’ve loved you for all these last 4 years. And I miss you terribly. I hope you’re okay. And I’ll see you soon.I’m so sorry that I haven’t been able to support you as much as you’ve needed it these past few weeks and months. It’s been hard for me, too. I always tell you that I’m there for you, but it’s just so draining to be the one who supports you. I wish I could make your pain vanish when I hold you tight as you cry in my arms. The sadness punctures a hole inside my heart when I see you break down like this. I don’t know what to do besides support you by just being here with you, in this moment. 

God, I love you, and sometimes you’re a royal pain in my butt. You’re a lot to deal with, but I love you just the same. I just wish I knew how to tell you.You broke me. Again and again. You abused me. Physically, mentally, emotionally. I told myself over and over if you ever hit me again I would take our baby and leave and not look back. I told myself I wouldn't let you treat me like that. That I wouldn't let put baby see you treat me like that. Rhat if you ever cheated on me I would be gone.

And yet here we are, now two kids deep and across the country from any support I had, during a global pandemic. You had an emotional affair for almost a year. 

Even after confronting you you didnt even have the decency to stop. Not until you got caught sending her dick pics. I should have called her. I should have messaged her husband. Should have destroyed her life like you destroyed all trust I had in you, in us. You blamed me for your shitty behaviour and bad choices. You blamed me from you lashing out. You blamed me for carrying our second baby and not paying enough attention to you between working and taking care of our one year old. I will never unsee the things you said to her. That will always break me. And yet, I have forgiven you even though you never apologized.


And now, after working myself to the bone, taking care of two young kids, all the house stuff, saying ontop of all the finances and still being the main breadwinner, that's not enough for you to not lash out at me. For something small. For something even you said wasn't or shouldn't be a big deal. You threatened me. You threatened to leave. 

Where do I find the courage. Where do I find the strength. Because I'm so tired. I'm so alone and sad and broken and scared. I'm scared of giving up almost 6 years of what I thought was a life with my forever person. Giving up being with the father of my two amazing little girls.im scared to make amy choice. Im scared to make the wrong one, which is probably the right one but what if it's not? I am scared of loving you. It physically hurts to love you. Because I love you so fucking much that im scared to mess up making dinner or not saying the right thing or not saying enough. Im scared to keep living this way and things getting worse because they need to get better. 

I have a solution to most of our problems. But you dont seem to have any interesting in hearing them. You dont think you need to change or work on yourself. But I am so broke  that I just need to be fixed and I need to do better and be better but how. How much more am I suppose to give up and change? There is nothing left. I dont recognize myself anymore. I'm not the same person I was 2 years ago let alone 6. We need to do better. We need to work together and to change. You always talk about how we are a team and a partnership and I need to include you. But it's so one sided and you won't see that. We have both changed and grown but we grew apart not together. We grew alone and I need you and you need me. You need help.


To my girls I am sorry. Im sorry mommy yells and cries and hides sometimes. Im sorry I am not stronger or braver. Im sorry. I love you more than life and I am trying to figure this out.I see it... I am putting together *alllll* of the things that i said, and how I said them now.... and when. 

Way too soon. Way too much. And way too many.   
  
No *wonder* you thought you could assume to know my feelings!   
  
You must think I'm bat shit crazy. Maybe I *am* bat shit crazy....   
  
I'm old, which kind of makes me new. I don't date. I don't even see people hardly at all. This was.... *unexpected,* to say the least.   
  
I didn't think... the fact that I was feeling something at all was too big for me. It was such a very terrifying situation for me.   
  
I'm not sure what went wrong inside of my head. But I really did just like you. I really would have liked to get to know you better. I understand that I will never get that chance now. I'm really angry with myself for being so flighty and insane. I really didn't expect anything from you, but I see now why you thought that I did.   
  
I'm sorry :(When you emailed me after finding out that I ended up dropping your class, it seemed oddly passive-aggressive and out of character for you. I may not have been in your class for much more than two months, but you still seem too understanding and kind to be genuinely mad at me for dropping, right? It's been bothering me for hours.

I made the decision to drop your class over any of my other ones for many reasons, some more selfish than others, but I feel you deserve nothing but upmost honesty. I believe that you assign ridiculous amounts of busywork that isn't necessary to understanding the content of the class. Until tonight, I've spent more time working on psychology than any other class, which is is overall disheartening and makes the class a lot less enjoyable for me. I know many of my peers cannot say the same, but I value the time I do not spend doing schoolwork. I hope you understand.

It is also probably necessary to clarify to you that things haven't been going well at home recently. Ever since I got a job, my mental and physical health have been declining rapidly. I know you make remarks that less and less students are turning on their cameras in class, but I'm doing it solely because I don't want you to be able to see the bags under my eyes and unkemptness of my hair. This is all too new for me to be able to handle everything at once, and I needed to do something before it became a more critical issue than it already is.

You approve of that, I hope? Mental health comes first?

I wish I could explain to you the things that are going on in my family, too, that are draining the life from me. As my psychology teacher, I know that you would understand how disagreements between parents and family members create a tense and uncomfortable living environment. I get so exhausted thanks to the arguments that my siblings and parents have that I unfortunately end up in the middle of to the point where it's kept me laying in my bed all day. I've showed up to some of your classes without ever getting up from my bed because it felt physically impossible.

I'm sorry for making this so long, but I feel that you need to know the full story if I am to explain to you why I ended up dropping your class. It was nothing you personally did- in fact, I'd say you were probably the nicest teacher I ended up having this year. In a different time and a different place, I would've loved to stay in your class and learn the wonderful things you have to teach me. I love psychology, I really do! I just can't take on AP psychology while also trying to saddle a job and my mental health spiraling downwards.

If you are upset at me, I understand why. What I did was selfish, but I want to believe that the extra time to myself will maybe help me get back on the right foot. I want to learn psychology, but I need to learn how to get my life together first.

I am very sorry for dropping your class-- please don't be upset at me. Have a nice rest of your evening.everyday, i think about how great is to have a friend like you. you stood by my side even when i was at my worst. it means so much to me, that i have you to stay with me no matter what i do. i am so toxic to you, such a bad friend, that i feel ashamed. sometimes i get so mad at you for all this unimportant things. sometimes i make you feel like you are not a priority for me. you are. you are always on my mind. “what if something bad happens to you? what will i do without you?” i constantly ask myself this things. i would do anything for you. when you are sad it breaks my frickin heart and soul. i am a bad friend and i’m sorry for being like that.Dear "you",

I am very sorry for the last emails I sent.  I was wildly manic and unaware at the time that I was out of my mind.  It is not an excuse, but a reason.  Hard to explain but at the time, I thought you had lied to me about some really big things.  I am not certain I know the truth anymore, but I have made peace that I don't know the truth.

I am sure it was scary or weird.  I am sorry for putting you through that.  I have been sick for a long time and not aware of it.

I still miss you but have no hope to reach out because I am sure the delight in seeing my name show up in your emails is long gone.  It has been almost a year, but I won't reach out again- I promise.

I am sorry and hope you have a good life.It must be tiring. Listening to me, whine and moan about my life. I never ask you about yours. I am sorry about that.

Maybe it is because you don’t judge me. Or perhaps you are just nice. I think I trust you because you just listen. 

I have told you things I am too scared to tell anybody else. You are not family, I guess not really a friend either? 

A confidant. 

But I understand that this is not your job. You are not a qualified listener and can only offer so much. 

But I wanted you to know that I am grateful. I probably don't show it enough. I do not really know how?


I would be in a much scarier place. 

You help me more than you realise. And I am sorry for putting that pressure on you.My dear friend,
I am bad luck. A cursed rabbit foot, black cat, or a broken mirror; take your pick. I carry myself as a charm, but deep down, I know that I bring misfortune to those around me. 

I try hard to stay positive. I try hard to help those around me be at peace. But I'm not at peace with myself. How contradicting of me to help others when I can't help myself. How god damn fucking pathetic that I choose to live and bring despair to those I love. I am not selfless. I'm selfish. 

I am become death,
Destroyer of worlds.You deserved so much more than this. SO MUCH MORE...

Your life was special. It was important. 

No one deserves to die alone.

I am unequivocally heartbroken and sorrowed that you had nobody by your side.

We couldn't get there in time.

I hope you aren't angry. I hope you aren't in any pain.

I am sorry.To you, I am sorry if I have said something which offended you. I honestly did not mean to. I am sorry if you find me “fake” and does not totally understand your feelings. Maybe, it’s the way I have worded that statement that hurt you. 

If you find this and read this perhaps, I hope you’ll go on with your journey. Always stay safe, and take care of yourself.To my best friend, T:

I'm sorry I was so harsh on you this morning.

I'm sorry I told you I was disappointed in you and your actions.

I'm sorry I refused your offer of meeting up for a drink.

I'm sorry I took longer than I should've done to call you back after my dinner.

When your work colleague messaged me through FB and told me what you'd said to her and others, my heart sank. I knew you'd been struggling and, with hindsight, I now know that earlier you were crying out for...something. Love? Attention? Help? All three? I should've seen it. I should've known and I should've been more compassionate. Instead, I'm sat here writing this through a veil of tears, knowing that I may well have been the tipping point for you to decide that attempting to overdose and end your life was the only option you had left.

Thankfully, you're OK...or as OK as you can be. Finally knowing you were alive, albeit in hospital, is the biggest relief I've had in almost 32 years of existing. That relief has turned to anger. Hatred. Disgust. All at myself. You told me your mom thinks I'm wonderful and that she thinks, much to your bemusement, I'd make a great partner for you because I look after you so much and make you laugh so much. I wonder if she feels that way right now? I doubt it, and nor should she.

You told me the other day that you've bought some gifts for me, as a thank you for looking out for you over these last few months. I promised I'd always support you, be there and look out for you. Today I failed you in that promise and I hope you know, from the bottom of my heart, I am more sorry than I've ever been in my life. If, by some miracle, you decide I'm still worth knowing then just know that this has been a lesson learnt and I vow I will look after you and be there for the rest of your life.

Until then, get all the rest you need, get well soon and know that I love you with all my heart.

M
xI saw you pass by at the lake the other day, and I couldn't help but stare. Even though it was just your back facing me, I knew it was you. Thoughts rushed through my mind, *Is that you?, How are you?, How have you been?* And at that moment you turned around a bit, I confirmed that it was you, not just someone who looked like you. In the brief few seconds that felt like minutes, my heart sank as our eyes met. I wanted to say something, but something, I'm not sure what it was, held me back. And just as I was about to raise my hand to wave, you looked away and then drove off into the distance, once again. The last words you said to me rang constantly in my mind throughout the rest of the day. 

It's been long since my eyes met yours but you still cross my mind time and time again. I know you'd be surprised to hear that and you might wonder how the person who broke you, still thinks of you. Maybe, I'm the person you're talking of to your friends, if not the least, I'm the villain of your story. I am the one who you'll be talking about when heartbreak is mentioned. I'm the one you'll be remembering as the one who didn't appreciate you. I know you owed me so many tears, so many shattered dreams. I know you've been trying to start from every piece, but it's hard. I know you've been trying to understand that maybe I loved you a little less or maybe I didn't in the first place. 

Maybe everyone around you told you that I wasn't the best thing that ever happened to you, that I was ruthless, I was a sadist for breaking you. I know so because I have spent so much time trying to forget you, trying to make peace with you and your memories. And every time my heart ached at the time, every time my eyes teared, the only one I could think of was you. Crazy isn't it? How you can just never look back, despite what has happened. You must be wondering, how can I feel all this if I was the one who let you down. 

I know it's hard to trust me, but when I let you down, and then you walked away, my heart broke too. It's hard for you to trust me when I say, I also had nights when I couldn't just embrace myself and sleep. Of course, I treasured you. You gave me so much, and I gave so much to you too, but at the time, I didn't know what feelings were, nor  did I understand love. I just knew you were special, but I didn't know what to do. I was so oblivious to all your feelings, and I let you down by not giving you an answer. Maybe if I had a bit more time, a bit more clarity, things would've been different. Either of us would not have been so hurt today. And now, I'm not sure what's worse, breaking the person you treasured the most or breaking yourself piece by piece. After all, I wish I was able to trade my happiness so that you can be happy.

I let you down because I didn't know better and was a mess, but I treasured you with all my heart. You deserve someone who wasn't chaotic. Someone who could give you their world happily and not let anything, including their intrusive thoughts, come between. I have exhausted my soul trying to look for the best words to express my regrets to you. I won't justify myself by saying that you didn't give me enough time, that you didn't try much. You did try. You loved me so much that I could feel it in every word you uttered. You loved me so much that I knew I had a home somewhere in someone's heart. I am sorry for breaking your heart, for making you wish you never knew me. I'm sorry for making you feel like you never mattered. I'm sorry for letting you down. We may have been ripping each other apart but I won't be lying when I say, you have all the rights to distance yourself.

You've had your share of terrible dark nights. Nights that were too long, nights that were filled with sobs, wishes, regrets, cries, and memories. I'm sorry for breaking you apart when I wasn't at peace with myself. But I looked you up the other day, hours after our eyes met, you seem happier in the photos. Whether they were with your friends or of the adventures you went on or the photos with your girlfriend, your eyes and smile shone brighter, with more life. Perhaps my assumption was right after you looked away. You moved on, and maybe you're happier. 

And well, I need you to know that I have always wanted you to be happy. Seeing you with someone else in photos, I've gotta say, did eat me up, because I wasn't able to provide you that happiness you so deserved. And here I am now, full of thoughts. Full of a mixture of emotions: nostalgia, bittersweetness, memories, sadness, and a few chuckles. I'm not sure if I can put what I really feel into words. 

For all I know though, I hope you're happy. While you weren't able to be the one who granted me the happiness you so said you wanted to give, I've found someone who is able to put a smile on my face every day, making me feel so loved. And I hope the same goes for you too. I hope you find love and happiness in her, and I hope that she's able to care for you in ways I couldn't. 

It seems like we've both moved on and grown in our own ways. We both now have the love of our life by our sides, and our paths have now diverged. But I'll never forget you, and I genuinely wish you well. I hope you've moved on and found someone who knows how to love you and understands you fully. I know you deserve better and I'm sorry I couldn't give it to you. I was so busy trying to pick myself and making peace with my nightmares that I forgot how to care for you and appreciate you a little more. 

I'm sorry.Hi daddy,

I'm sorry. Is it going to be the 11th or the 12th anniversary of your death in a month?  The 12th, I think.  Sometime before my 22nd birthday and before your 51st. I would give anything in the world to have you back. I would give anything to have more time with you. I've spent a third of my life without you, and it isn't fair. 

I know it's my fault, though. I was a stupid, selfish child. I knew how sick you were. I knew that my being there helped you. You didn't drink while I was there. I was so overwhelmed with the idea of caring for you, I didn't want to watch you die. But I would take it back now if I could. If I could I would get into my car and drive straight to you.

I'm so sorry I left, Daddy.  I'm sorry you were alone. I still remember the sound of your voice, how sad you seemed when you called me ... not four days before they found you.  I was coughing so hard so I had rushed you off the phone, and I'm sorry. If I had known it was the last time I would ever hear your voice, I would have stayed on the phone, no matter how much I was coughing.

I'm sorry for all the emails I didn't respond to. I'm sorry for all the times I didn't call. I'm so sorry I left you to die by yourself.

I can't write anymore now. It hurts too much and I can't see through the tears. 

I'm so, so, sorry, Daddy.

&#x200B;

Love,

Snickerdoodleyknow, the worst thing about this is, i know you dont hate me.  
i know you WANT to talk to me and i know you in some capacity still enjoy my presence, but i just cant do this anymore.  


talking to you makes me feel like im stuck on a string. i just .. cant do it anymore. i love you so much and you know that. i think thats why you keep doing this to me.  
im not even sure if youre doing this on purpose.   


i dont know if i want to talk to you anymore. i dont know if i still like you. ill always love you, of course, but liking you is a whole different issue. youre such a different person now.  


i miss when we were kids. i remember, we were 14, and he was hitting on me. i was telling you about how gross he was and about the gross things he said, among those was that he deserved me and that hed marry me. i told you that. and i remember, you said "okay, well yeah, i'd marry you too, who wouldnt?" and then you moved on from that, talking about how you were sorry he was doing that.  


i still remember that. i remember it very clearly. it was the first time i can remember feeling like somebody genuinely loved me.  


i love you so much and im sorry i have to cut things off this way. i know we'll talk again at some point, just not now or soon.   


you always know where i am if you need me.  
i love you, dont do anything stupid.I keep apologizing. You hate it. You say it makes you suspicious. I apologize because I don’t feel good enough in any aspect, and I’m genuinely sorry that I can’t be better for you. I’ve been thinking about something that happened in my past a lot. I think it’s to blame for a lot of my issues; especially not feeling good enough when it comes to being emotionally supportive. I might try and tell you about it tomorrow. It might make things make a little more sense. We’ve had many conversations about not bottling up my problems because I feel like a burden on you, but I just keep doing it. It makes you anxious and I absolutely hate that I do that. I hate knowing I cause you stress. You’re going through a really tough time, and I wish I knew all the right things to say to make you feel better, but I feel like I’m doing the complete opposite. Like everything I say and do just brings you down. I can’t be emotionally supportive. I’m not good at it. I don’t understand your emotions. I don’t understand what you might want to hear to cheer you up. I don’t know how I can be there for you more. I’m so damn sorry I can’t be more help.I was a toxic person without knowing it, but I know that now. I deserve every bit of hurt that our separation brought me. 
I know it wasn't soully me; you moved quickly and I went along with that passively and you didn't communicate well with me , but I naively wasn't able to see what I was doing was wrong without being directly told. And I projected my own problems on to you. I was also, quote frankly, a manipulative piece of shit. Looking back, our relationship was toxic, and I was the main cause of that, but I want you to know that I've become a better person and you taught me how to do that.
Romantically, im over you, and I don't want you to think this is me trying to get you back. And honestly? I understand you not even wanting to be friends, but I just hope one-day you'll heal well from what I did and you'll be able to be in the same room as me without panicking. I hope one day youll be able to make eye contact with me when we pass by eachother and look at eachother with indifference rather than hurt.Sorry to bother you. I'll go after this, I promise.
I've just spent the last week thinking about why. 

I remember you used to say that something I did was fucking with your head. I can't remember what exactly it was, I think it was my inability to straight up tell you what was wrong. That caused you to have to worry about me and if I was ok on top of your struggles.
I know you struggle with the loss of your parents, you ever cried one night on the phone when you spoke about your mother. I had to mute my mic so you didn't hear me sob. 

I'm really sorry I added to your struggles. You came to me because you probably thought I was fun and would distract you from your pain, but instead I brought my own. My pains are nothing compared to yours and I know that if I had just met you and been able to spend time with you, away from my brothers, that everything would have been alright. 

I wish I had more time with you. But I suppose sometimes our time with people gets cut short and there's nothing we can do about it. 

I'm sorry I was such a burden.
I'd still love to meet you one day.
I'll be here waiting, I promise I'm changing. 

I really miss hearing your laughs and having a phonecall every morning.
Goodbye MiahnaI’m sorry I’m controlling. I’m sorry I let my anxiety control me. I don’t mean to need control but I spiral into a panic if I don’t prepare for situations. I’m trying my best to give you the space you asked for though... but it kills me inside to not talk to you and know you’re mad. I also feel like you’re going to talk to your family about what we are going through and they will hate me in the end... please answer my texts. I miss you...You left me confused and drained,

I find I am drowning in my complicated thought which is almost like a mathematic equation, (You hate mathematics, I still remember it). 

The fact that I am still constantly checking my phone while hoping that you will send me another dank memes even though I know that we are not talking anymore and I still listen to your recommendation songs despite the fact that I am not a fan of "that" genre. Everytime I see your favourite show on tv, I would be smiling ear-to-ear. Not because of it is hilarious but it reminds me of your sweet soul. I hate it when I can't get you outta my mind, You have been an aimless astronaut, lingering in the space of my mind. Meanwhile I am stranded here alone surrounded by the darkness. Your love used to illuminate the way but now it's gone.I know I told you I was gonna stop eating again, but I didn't choose a day or set a time. Saying I'm going to stop eating and actually going through with it are two different things. I know you try not to be disappointed in my my decisions as they are mine to make, but you've always told me when you disagree.

I don't know if this decision was irrational or just an impulse but it was me who made it either way. Today was day one of no eating but you'll never know.

Im gonna tell you I've been eating and save you your worry. I'll just tell you that it's hard when I know my thoughts aren't healthy, and that its hard to tell the difference between rational thoughts and disordered thoughts. 

Im sorry im going to lie but its for your own good. I know you've told me you'd rather know the truth then have to wonder but this way saves you worry and wonder. I try not to, but I can lie well when I have to. Its basically what I was tough when I was younger. I try to be honest with you but this is for me.

I know when I start showing symptoms you'll know, but I hope you don't blame yourself. This is my choice and I stand by it, its not as bad as it seems. I hope you'll forgive for the lies I tell but I'll understand if you don't. 

I'm not going to fully isolate you and I'll do my best to be honest about everything else. It'll be harder for me to lie but I don't want to hurt anyone more than I already have. This decision alone is destructive and will cause a lot of lies but that's okay. Im a liar, thats not okay. 

Don't worry I'll be safe. I hope you believe me when I say I really am sorry. Im sorry for any future hurt, I'm doing my best to make this painless.This is going to be it. Tonight, I'm going to let myself cry. I'm going to wallow in my self-pity. I'm going to let myself feel however I need to feel. 

Then tomorrow, I'm leaving. I'm cutting you out. I feel bad doing it this way, but I'm not going to hate myself for it. I'm tired of always blaming myself. 

I've been through enough. I've sacrificed enough for other people. For once I'm going to let myself be selfish and I'm not going to apologize for it.I always think about you , I feel stupid and pathetic because , you probably barely remember I exist . I don't blame you , I know I was the one who made everything so difficult and I'm sorry . they say you most likely don't care , I don't know if you do , but I want to apologize for all these times I walked  away , all these times I was almost begging for your attention so immaturely , I'm sorry . I wonder if it ever made you feel bad , when I acted this way , came to you all these times only to leave so suddenly , I wonder if you thought you didn't matter to me , if you thought I only wanted your body , if you thought I was childish , if you thought I'm a liar . I hope you didn't , because it's just not true . you're everything , you deserve the world , I wish I could give you the world , but I can't give you anything , I can't even leave you alone for once and for all , I'm sorry .

 I'm sorry I miss you all the time  and can't help myself , but I don't want to be like that anymore , maybe I'm so full of myself thinking that you care enough to be bothered by it but it's unfair to you anyways , so I won't text you again just because I miss you so much only to get scared later and hide for months .  I hope you're happy , I want you to be happy but I also selfishly wish that you would miss me at least  a little  even just as your friend but it feels like it's just me , that's okay .

I watched that movie you like tonight , it made me so sad , and miss you so much more but it was beautiful . I never cried because of you before , not even when you told me you liked somebody else , But tonight I find myself sobbing because it's just too much , these past two days you were everywhere even when you weren't there . 

I feel so pathetic that even when we never really dated , you still have so much control over me , it's the reason why I run away everytime , but even when I haven't seen you in three years , I just walk around near your place and I feel do wrecked , like , there's a bleeding hole in my chest , I was scared I would meet you there but I also wanted to , I wanted to see your smile in real life again . I know I should do my best to forget about you , but I just don't want to , and I'm sorry , I can't stand the idea that I'm forgetting what your voice sounds like , or that your face is fading away from my memory , I hate it . I hate that I'm crying over you like this , I hate that I miss you so much , I hate that I have no self-control when it's about you . 

I want to tell you so many things , but I shouldn't , I want to , at least tell someone else but I really can't and it doesn't even matter if you're not the one hearing it anyway . 

I just hope you're okay , and safe , I wish that you would reach out for once , it's okay if you don't , I'll just remember the good times we had together .I think what hurts the most is you completely forgot about all the times I was there for you when you lost yourself. When you lost who you were and you lost the most important quality about yourself, I didn’t move. I stood by your side when you lost sight of who you became, and there I was, gently holding your hand, leading you back to where you should be. I never thought about leaving, because all that didn’t matter to me. What mattered to me was you, not the fame, not how other people viewed you, but who you were without all that. When you thought I was no longer a “service” to you, you tossed me away. Like some piece of trash that was discarded after its purpose was fulfilled. You forgot that I was there with you through thick and thin, and I never left. I stood by your side and encouraged you it was going to be ok. But now, here you are, with someone else. Someone who only sees you for your fame and fortune, for your glory and the fantasy self you want to portray, but I know the real you. The real person who is entrapped behind the fasad of how everyone else should see you. You left me for her, and I feel sorry for you. Because one day, youre going to look back and understand how much I loved you. Youre going to realize when its too late- and youre going to panic, and everything around you is going to crumble once again, but this time you will not have me. You will be faced with your grueling lonliness, your empty heart, and your false identity. And no one will be able to save you this time, you will have to face the music, the sound of your own symphony. The cries of your cold soul. And that is punishment enough.I cannot tell you over phone or text. I know this will never reach you. But I’m sorry for how it ended between us. You deserved better than me and I knew it. I couldn’t hurt you anymore so I left. I knew you were better off without me. 

I hope you’re doing well.I’m sorry for being selfish. I’m sorry for playing the victim. I’m sorry for being so afraid of hurting myself or my ego that I kept everyone at arms length.

I’m sorry that I’m too much of a coward to actually kill myself, and I’m sorry that I’ve considered that so rationally. At least we know it won’t happen. 

I don’t know who I turned into, and I fucking hate myself for it. The first step is awareness, and now it’s ever present in the forefront of my mind. 

I have no idea what’s going to happen. All I can do is my best to put others first again, and own up to my own shit. Admit when I’m wrong or don’t know, and actively stop being so afraid of a bruised ego or hurt feelings. Trying to protect myself and not hurt those I care about has actively hurt them; in turn going back and hurting me. 

It’s going to be a long ass road, but I’ll put as many blisters on my feet as it takes to rebuild my sense of self worth and relationships with those around me. 

It’s time to figure this shit out and start seeing things from the outside in, and stop being (what I perceive) as a manipulative, toxic, narcissist. I want to give off a vibe of love and positivity again, once I learn to love myself.I'm sorry for all the wrong things I have done to you. And now that you're gone, I am nothing but an empty shell. 

I'm sorry for misusing your trust like it didn't worth anything. I'm sorry that when things mattered, I refused to put down my ego and pride. 

You told me you had already lost feelings for me since August, but yet you decided to stay with me until October. I guess you did this to get back at me, and I don't blame you on that. I deserve it.

Seeing you all smiles with another guy broke me. I've never seen you smile and laugh like this in such a long time, and it was at that moment I knew I had failed you throughout our relationship, how I failed to keep you happy, how I failed to work harder to provide for you. But at least you could have told me that you met a new guy, instead of being cold to me all of the sudden. I guess he can give you what I couldn't, but I hope he truly loves you and not making use of you.

I miss your smiles, I miss your touch. I miss your smell and I miss you. I'm sorry, you can put the blame on me.I’m actually so happy with you. I know it’s hard to believe because I always let my insecurities get the best of me. But I could see myself falling in love with you.

I am so new to dating. Whenever I get close to someone I am so deeply afraid of being vulnerable. It brings so many emotions out of me and I just don’t know how to process it...so I don’t. But you have so much patience with me. You remind me every time you really like me.

That’s the risk you take with relationships, you never know how genuine someone is being. You’ll never know their every thought. It’s hard for me to believe anyone likes me because I feel so worthless. But you? You liking me? Impossible!!

I’m going to get better. I’m going to feel better. I want to believe you like me. You’re my boyfriend for fucks sake. And I like you. So so so so so much. I want to be with you for a long time.

Thank you for being here.You were right, I absolutely disrespected you. I knew you'd be calling, you call at the same time every week. I should've stopped what I was doing, and I shouldn't have told you about it. You have every right to be angry at me. I know that if you had done that to me, I'd be pissed off too.

Since you won't call back until tomorrow (I hope you'll still call...), I don't have any way to tell you I'm sorry. Its making me crazy, wishing I could explain and defend myself and wishing that I could tell you that I know I was wrong. I'm ashamed and depressed and I can't tell you how sorry I am. That's the most frustrating part, I think. I can't tell you that I was wrong and you were right. I can't say sorry. I can't let you know that I promise it won't happen again. At least I can't say it until you call me tomorrow. Its only 11am and I already feel like I'm going crazy. Tomorrow can't come fast enough.

I know I'm probably overthinking things and anxious for no reason, but part of me is scared you'll decide you hate me and want to end things. I think our relationship is stronger than that, and if a mistake is all it takes to break us then we didn't have nearly as strong of a relationship as I thought we did. I'm sure it will all be fine and we'll get through it, but I can't shake this fear that it'll be the beginning of the end. That you won't call me tomorrow because you'll still be pissed and upset, and it'll be another week before I hear from you, where we'll spend all week stewing in our pain and shame and anger.

I love you. I know I made a mistake and you definitely have every right and reason to be pissed off at me. It was disrespectful and I won't even try to make excuses for it, I'll just admit I was wrong. I hope you can you forgive me and I hope we can work it out. I love you so much, and I'm sorry.I just wanted to say that I’m sorry I’m so messed up. I wanted to say that I tried so hard to be ok. I hope that one day I will be ok & can let someone love me without the inescapable fear & panic I experience. I wanted to say thank you for being you. The good parts of you anyway. I will forever cherish our time & what you taught me. I love you into the next universe, and the next and the next... beyond all my turmoil, I love you. I’m sorry I don’t know how to get better any faster. I don’t know how to stop gnawing on this. On you, on us... I wish I could find the proper help. I don’t want to stay like this for forever. I want to be ok. I want to be loved, but I’m not ok, so no one can love me. I thought you understood bc you’re kinda like me. I thought you loved me bc you understood. I’m sorry for everything. I don’t know what else to do, but hope that you find happiness & the love you so desperately want. I wish this for myself as well. Thank you for loving me. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I release our bonds, spoken or otherwise. You are so beautiful, I wanted to keep you for myself. Not at the cost of your happiness though. I ask that we both find peace during this time. I ask that we both have strength. I ask that you never forget my love, as I will most definitely remember yours.I’m sorry I couldn’t be what you wanted

You have no idea how happy you made me and the fact I lost it all because I didn’t know what I should do will always drive me crazy

I can’t help but always think of you, every time I see another girl no matter who it is I can’t help but think “they’re still not as beautiful as you” 

You’re the only person I want, the only person I need 

If I could go back in time I’d redo it all so I could be what you wanted - what you needed 

These past two years have been nothing but low points for me and you distracted me from it for just a little while, though I wish you could’ve been mine longer 

And for that I’ll forever regret losing youI just had a realization. 

I know why you’re mad at me now. You used to accuse me all the time of using you, of playing games or stringing you along, as if I was some malevolent sadist eating your heart and then moving on to my next victim. Obviously I was offended. That’s not what happened from my perspective at all. I really thought maybe I could love you. 

But of course I couldn’t love you. Not then. Not now. Maybe in some parallel universe in which I felt I had some sort of place, somewhere I belonged and had committed to and would stay. But I was never meant to be in this world, I’ve known that since I was a child. This isn’t my home, this isn’t my body, this isn’t my mind. My family knew that well enough, which is why they never had very high expectations for me. But how could you have known? I do such a good job hiding how I feel that I almost convince myself nothing’s wrong. 

I know you’ll never trust me or believe a word I say, and that’s fine, welcome to my life. But I need you to know I wasn’t using you for all the reasons you seem to think. It’s almost worse than that. I really, really wanted to love you the way you seemed to love me. I really wanted it, needed it, to work, because when we met I had already made up my mind that I wouldn’t be around much longer. You were like a Hail Mary play at the bottom of the 9th (or something, you know I hate sports). You were the last chance I was going to give the world before I gave up on it. “Okay,” I thought, “let’s see who they sent me this time. One more chance.” Of course that wasn’t fair to you. We were never going to be anything. You weren’t a person to me, you were a test I was giving the universe to see if I was right the whole time about it. Love was never in the cards. You would have needed to be Jesus the literal fucking Christ in order to convince me to stay. How could you possibly have passed this test? You couldn’t have. It was like a dare to the universe instead of a relationship. “One more strike and we’re done.” I designed us to fail in order to convince myself that I had been right all along for wanting to go. 

Do you see? It was never about anything tangible. It was never about love. I could say I needed you as my life raft but that’s not true. You were a step in my suicide plan. I used you to help me kill myself. Now I can say, “He’s why.” And the scariest fucking part is that I don’t even realize my brain does these things until it’s too late to stop. 

I’m sorry. You’re not why. You’re not anything to me anymore. You never were. If you were waiting for me to give you permission to stop caring about what happened, you have my permission. It had nothing to do with you at all. Being mad at you is the only thing that’s kept me going still, feeding off the last dregs of my own emotions, the basest: anger, fear, resentment. But of course I can’t mould you into an avatar of everything I hate about this world, an effigy of humanity to burn as the sun goes down while I stick a proverbial shotgun in my mouth. I came close to, but I’m not angry anymore. I’m not afraid. Once those fell away, so did you and my image of you. 

Now it’s just me. I’m the only person I have any right to resent. I don’t belong here. Everybody else wants to live forever, but I never have. I want to close my eyes and drift off to sleep and float away on the breeze. No pain, no suffering, no purgatory. I already feel free, my soul is calm, like a plume of steam caught in this cage of bone and muscle yearning to be let go. I’m not in any danger, don’t worry. I have some things to settle first. I just wanted to say that you don’t have to be angry with me anymore, if you still are. If you’re holding onto resentment, let it go. It doesn’t matter anymore. 

I’m really sorry. Wrong place, wrong time, wrong people. That’s all it was. Love? Love wouldn’t have been enough either way. What a silly thought, in retrospect. Love is just another attachment. A sandbag holding down a balloon. I’ve let go of all of my mine now. I’ve flown away. You’re stuck on the ground hating me for not bringing you along. Don’t. I was leaving before I even arrived. 

Time to see what’s next.I'm so sorry.

It's been a good while now since you left, over two years actually. And whilst I'm healed I don't think I'll ever fully forgive myself for letting you slip away, for becoming someone who you couldn't bare to be with anymore. I'm sorry for becoming a shell of a human being. 

I'm sorry for making you fall out of love with me. 

I dream about you, a lot. About how I would apologise, but you never accept the apology before I wake. 

I was toxic. I took you for granted. I wanted to get drunk so much to cover up my non-existent self-esteem all whilst you were there loving me every single day, you are so kind and I didn't deserve you. I can't forgive myself, for any of it. 

And now I will forever have to live with the fact that I won't be able to spend my life with you, and that it's my doing and nobody else's, it's a hard pill to swallow when all I can reflect on is my own wrong doing. 

It changed me .. it has changed me so much, you have changed me so much. 

I'm better now, I'm a better person because I realised I can't ever experience any level of loss like that again in my life time. So I went out there and became the best person I can be .. I'm still working on it.

I wish you could meet me now and forget old me, I wonder if you'd fall in love with me all over again? 

Loving you forever. 

XI never wanted you to get caught in the crossfire and while I knew that they were mean I didn't think they were this malicious. I miss you everyday and you are my most favorite people in the universe. I have asked many times to see you but I've been met with refusal or bargaining for items I am unable to give. 
I don't know if you've received the gifts I've sent you or the post cards and letters but, I still want to have a relationship with you. 
I love you immensely and I eagerly hope that one day in the future I am able to explain my actions and share my side of the story and reason for departure. 

Until then please know that I love you and leaving you behind was very, very difficult to do.i can’t help but wait for u to text me back. i can’t help but wait for u to call me. i can’t help but wait for u to come back to my arms. i know we ain’t ready to be together again but i want u more than i ever should. i want to be the first thing u see in the morning. i want to be the last person to hold u close at night. i jus want to be yours. but i know that between us n where we are in our lives we can’t be together. but i’m willing to wait for u. ill be here waiting for u, for when u come back to my arms again.

i love u, i always have. i’m sorry for breaking ur heart.  i’m sorry for losing ur trust, for letting u go when i shouldn’t have. i shoulda fought for us harder. i shoulda loved u more. but if we’re meant to be, i’ll wait for u. ill be right here. n ill hold u close to me, the same way i did.I'm not sorry for trying to find a resolution before letting you go. 

I'm not sorry for trying to get you to take the lunch I packed for you for tomorrow.

I'm not sorry for waiting this long for you. 

I'm not sorry for wanting a life with you. 

I'll never be sorry for loving you even when you don't love yourself.I don’t really care about your regrets. Well, I might be slightly happy that you do regret leaving me. But I’m tired. So tired. I don’t want to think about you anymore.

How you were simply a cheater. Of course you’d regret that relationship. You built it on untrust-worthy foundation. The euphoria that your paramour had since she felt that she “won” over me eventually ended because that was never really the case. She’d realize that she’s just someone “easier.” She had everything I didn’t have but she also don’t have anything that I do have. She’s just a new flavor. And she realized that soon enough, because in the first place she couldn’t even trust you. You’d regret losing me, because you now had the idea of what you’ve lost. I don’t need to count them for you, you definitely know them for yourself already.

But regardless of your regret, I just can’t take you back anymore. Not when you totally turned a blind eye on the things we’ve been through and the things I’ve done for you when we were together. Not when you even ended up blaming me for your monkey-branching tendencies – and I was stupid enough to believe you. I have exerted all the effort to “correct my ways,” belatedly realizing that it was just you who tried to find comfort from another person when you had me. I realized how you had already painted me badly inside your head, to the point of cheating on me because you felt like I was deserving of that disrespect. 

I don’t need you to understand my sacrifices. I did them on my own volition and it’s just sad that you wasted them. But I already forgave myself for that. On the other hand, I can’t forgive you. You ruined a good part of my life that I can’t be “happy that it happened.” I am now “happy that it ended.” You were right with your fake reasons before – I don’t really deserve you. 

I will never, ever, give you the forgiveness. Don’t think of passing the baton to me just to remove your guilt. I will never carry the burden of “needing to forgive you.” I will carry on with my life without you.I hope you forgive me. I love you, and want to take you away from the witch known as our mouther. I escaped, but you are only 6. I cant aford to feed myself, jobless, and living off kindness from outhers. You dont deserver to be beat, told you are nothing, or to see manny things you have. Your dad is a crack head who wants nothing to do with you. Your grandparents are dead, or in anouthe county. Im the only shot you have to feel normal, but i cant go back. If i go back ill be draged back in. She was alot more irasponcable when i was a kid. I got raped manny times and nearly sex traphiced due to her hard drug use. She was also alot nicer. When she was younger we had small good moments, and even a year or 2 where she was sober, and taking her meds for her mentle condishon. I still had to deal with her abusive boyfriends 2 who even tryed to kill her. I lerned to take care of myself. She went to religon, and became an exstremist. She had only rarly beat me with a bealt befor then,but then she started to beat me till she got tiered. I had no freedome any more as i was entering into purberty. I had a secret girlfiend who comited suicide, but if i would of told my mom or anyone and it got back to her i was so afrade she would beat me so hard, and lock me away with only the flore a window and a bible. Atlest she stoped everything but drinking though.I tryed to get out as mutch as i could, but then you were borne when i was 13. I took care of you 90% of the time. I love you so mutch. The goverment got involved sevel times. Nothing happened due to her fake smile. I would be punished eatch time. I took her wrath for me and you. If you messed up id take the punishments. I was suicidle at that point, and i think she wanted me to end it so what little she hadnt taken away she did. My drawing shows, and my phone to talk to anyone. You were the only reason i didnt do it. I never wanted kids, but ibwant to take you in and away from her. She seems more stable, and you seem to be being taken care of by her nice bf. He is a good mad who i respect. I know you are still being told you are nothing though. That anger inside you flares up. When it doues i cant help but think of how big you will be when you are older. You will one day be able to hurt her bad. She will be 60 when ur 18. I had saved her life mannny times, and keep her from drowning in her own vomet, burning alive, and being shot. I protected her cus my dads last words to me were take care of her. But that was befor he died, and she got into drugs as hard as she did. She was a nice peraon one i promiss. I think she still can be if treated .....but dont hold out hope like i did mabby not i uest to see glimpses, but now i havent seen any in years. Let her die you will be better off in foster care. I was so scared of letting him down, and being sent to a bad famly and repatedly raped i let her live. I nearly killed her when she was pregnet with you. I wanted to save you befor it was to late, but i desided not to. I had her drink and pills to od her right infront of me side by side. Everyone would have asumed od or suicide. I still love her in a fucked up way little bro. Im so fucked up i have ptsd, depreshen,and amxiety. Im scared if/when i take you i wont be able to take care of you. I have her in my dna, and may have the same condishons but just not showing yet. I cant aford help right now for what i do have. I want to save you but cant take care of me. You are fairly stable right now, but when that man leaves her life you will suffer even more. I want to catch you, but im afrade i wont be abble tom im trying my best to get on my feet. For me and you. She took my childhood, but she wont take my adulthood to. I love you. Im sorry. Im sorry. Im sorry.


Ps. I gave the last amout of monny i had saved into a dollertree toy for your birthday. Im sorry it isnt mutch, but i think you will still like it.***I’m sorry to you…***

I’m sorry that my insecurities ruined our relationship.

I’m so sorry that I didn’t understand that, in that moment, you really cared.

I’m sorry that I texted you my feelings instead of saying them face to face.

I’m sorry that we’ll never see each other again.

Most of all, I’m sorry that I caused you any pain.

I know you’ve moved on and I don’t exist for you anymore. I wanted to be better for you but I was too scared you would leave so I drove you away. I’m sorry I did that.

***I’m sorry to myself….***

For not believing it when someone really cares for me.

For not asking for help.

For being unable to accept love.

For ruining the only really real relationship I’ve ever known.

For destroying my own happiness, repeatedly.

I’ve lived a great life and I’ll keep living this one until it’s my time to go. If that time is soon, I’m ok with that. I’m sorry to myself for feeling this way. I didn’t want to.

*I’m sorry that there is no us. I’m sorry that I’ll learn to spend my days laughing with someone else. And I’m really sorry that it’s better this way.* ***I know that I created this. Please accept my apology.***for liking the things that you do. Who cares if that track is "too angsty," that tv show "too nerdy," that hobby "too weird?" 

Who cares if I like it too or not? 
You're my friend, and it makes you smile. I love that. 

You. Are. Lovely.hey, i’m sure i’m the last person you want to hear from, but i acted like a dick to you towards the end of high school and it’s kind of eating at me, so i just wanted to actually apologize. it sucks that i just cut you off with no explanation, and in doing that, i never wanted to alienate you from the rest of our friends, especially not during a rough time for you, and it seems like that’s what happened. i don’t think i’m wrong in saying that in our friendship, we both caused each other a lot of stress, and we weren’t meshing particularly well and hadn’t been for some time. i figured back then that telling you that and explaining myself would make you feel worse, so i just gave you the cold shoulder, but i can see now that that was really childish and probably did a lot more harm than good. i really, really didn’t mean to cut you off from a huge portion of your support system, and i don’t say that to absolve myself of blame because i did it whether i meant to or not, but i’m saying it to let you know that i don’t hold that much malice towards you, you aren’t and never have been hated by me, and i wouldn’t have let that happen if i hadn’t been so shortsighted and selfish. i was going through a difficult time, yes, but you were going through a more difficult time. i respect you for your strength and drive, and i’ve had enough dreams lately where i’m apologizing to you that i just felt like i should finally actually stop being a coward and do it. you probably still think i’m a bitch, and that’s fine, i was a bitch to you. i don’t need you to respond to this or acknowledge it if you don’t want to, i just needed to say it.Dear M,

This is not really a letter I want to write because these are literally the last things I have to tell you. And after this... I don't know what excuse I could come up with to talk to you in my head. I guess I need to hit that wall though.

I'm sorry that I got upset over completely asinine stuff that didn't matter whatsoever. I'm sorry that I was pissy over you wanting to put a bed cover on the mattress. I'm sorry that I was resistant to having an additional sheet on the bed. I'm sorry that I wouldn't buy you a lamp for the living room when the living room was fucking dark and you had legitimate night vision issues. I'm sorry that I still put up a hissy fit when you bought one for yourself to use. And I'm sorry that I would freak the fuck out when you would leave the light on. I'm sorry that I would freak the fuck out when you'd leave any electronic device even plugged in after you were done using it. I'm sorry that I always put my comfort first. I'm sorry that we didn't cuddle at night. I'm sorry that I would control the house temperature. I'm sorry that I tried to make you feel bad about liking yarn and knitted clothing just because I didn't like touching it. I'm sorry that I tried to narrow your social supports outside of me. I'm sorry I thought Dungeons & Dragons was completely stupid. I'm sorry that I also tried to get you to stop going to those DnD meetings. I'm sorry that I didn't want to socialize with your family. I'm sorry that I got upset when you would discuss our issues with other people. I'm sorry that I treated inconveniences to me as more important than your legitimate concerns. I'm sorry that I was deeply annoyed that you requested we use separate cookware because you have celiac's disease, and I regularly cooked pasta. I'm sorry that I wanted to intrude on any time that you took for yourself. I'm sorry that I would request insistently to take showers with you and would become deeply depressed when you turned me down. I'm sorry that I would prod the limits of your boundaries. I'm sorry that I was an ass. I'm sorry that I made you feel bad for being startled. I'm sorry that I took pleasure in startling you. I'm sorry that I teased you incessantly. I'm sorry that I teased you about not knowing directions. I'm sorry that I teased you about forgetting things. I'm sorry that I continued to tease you about things you explicitly asked me not to tease you about. I'm sorry that I pressured you to have sex when you were not in the mood. I'm sorry that I would pressure you to eat meat when you were a vegetarian. I'm sorry that I routinely went to restaurants that didn't cater to your diet at all. I'm sorry that I roped your mom in to pressuring you to eat fish. I'm sorry that I took every chance I could to praise how good meat is, especially bacon. I'm sorry that I dehumanized animals in front of you. I'm sorry that I wasn't supportive of changes you wanted to make to yourself. I'm sorry that I didn't want you to wear make-up. I'm sorry that we didn't end up holding hands more frequently after you mentioned you thought we should. I'm sorry that I dismissed things you wanted to share with me. I'm sorry that I didn't get the hint that Pinterest would have been way for you to tell me what you wanted to do, what you would enjoy, and what you would like to receive as gifts. I'm sorry that I didn't celebrate your accomplishments. I'm sorry that I didn't take your anxiety seriously. I'm sorry that I insisted you drive in large cities when I knew it caused you anxiety. I'm sorry I had you drive in the snow. I'm sorry I had you drive at night. I'm sorry I would play the music too loud in the car and would become pissed off when you asked me to turn it down. I'm sorry that my impulsiveness put my priorities in the wrong order. I'm sorry that I drove your car at stupidly high speeds on the interstate while you were sleeping in the back seat. I'm sorry that I would rather spend money on pointless crap when I could have bought a car to drive out to see you. I'm sorry that I pressured you to buy things that you didn't want to buy. I'm sorry that I was always either too little or too much. I'm sorry that I would freak out to you about what complete strangers did in public. I'm sorry that I would give you the silent treatment when I was angry or frustrated. I'm sorry that I thought it would be acceptable to buy another girl that you were already jealous of a set of pillowcases for Christmas. I'm sorry that I left you responsible for paying the rest of the rent in our old apartment. I'm sorry that I thought I was being a reasonable person the entire time. I'm sorry for several more things that wouldn't pass a PG-13 rating.

But most of all... I'm sorry that there were good times in between all that bullshit. I didn't think of it like this at the time. But a lot of that bullshit was legitimate emotional abuse. And I didn't do this purposefully, but spreading positive things in between emotional abuse reinforces an abused person to stay where they are. And that's what I was doing for years, whether I meant it or not. I'm sorry.

I had always thought that if I had met the past me in some way that me and him would get along. I'd think he would have some things to learn, but he would learn them in time because he was smart. I would have given him a hug because some tough times are ahead. But now... now I would tell people to stay away from him and force him to get help. And I would stay with him until he got better. He wasn't ever going to hurt anyone physically, but he was hurting other people. And he was ruining everything for himself.

I'm sorry that I sent you a physical letter. It turns out that that was just another form of emotional abuse that I wasn't aware of. I thought I knew what was going on in my head when I sent it. But apparently there's more than that. I'm beginning to realize that remission of my personality disorder may be more difficult to achieve than I had anticipated. And now I know that I might not know everything... As recently as last week, I still hoped that I would hear from you at some point. But this is a delusion. I won't hear from you ever again.

I can't express how much I value you. And that sounds like such a sick thing to say when I look back on how I treated you. But since you left, I've had a mental copy of you in the back of my head. I know it isn't you as you are now. But she's still there telling me to calm down, telling me to listen to other people, telling me to be understanding, telling me to be empathetic, telling me to care, telling me to help others when I can, telling me to stop being so full of myself, telling me to work on myself. And she's still drawing layouts on tables with her fingers to start a story.

I wish I knew myself. It's really fucking weird having BPD and possibly NPD, having the self-awareness that many of my thoughts, emotions, and actions have roots in personality disorders, knowing what is that I'm supposed to be working towards, but never being sure if what I do is what a healthy person would do. Everything is like dialed to 11 in my head, but I have to dial it back to like a 4, 5, or 6 to be healthy. But just about the only thing I know that I can do with certainty is dial it back to 0. And I can't differentiate the numbers 1-11. And all the while I find the whole damn thing simultaneously entertaining and depressing. It's so fucking weird.

Take care of yourself. And I hope you stay away from people that have been like me.

Goodbye,You didnt reply. I figure it's one of two things: you have me blocked, or you saw it and decided not to reply. I hope it's the latter because I need you to know I'm sorry for the things I said. I didnt mean them. And if we never talk again I need you to know that... well. I loved you and I always will.

I mean, I am glad you didnt reply. My heart may have given up the ghost if you had. Theres nothing you could say at this point that I'd be happy hearing, and nothing I could say to make you take back what you did. I'm glad we are out of each other's life but... I am sorry. I think I stand by my reaction but I should have said it a different way. I was angry. I was emotional.

I'm sorry. I hope you're somewhere happy.I apologize. 
I apologize for making you a priority.
I can see now from your behavior that was never something you wanted from me. 
I apologize for giving you space in my heart and thoughts.
You do not want to occupy them, much as you like to push me to background. 
I apologize for including you in my life.
You have shown me there is no place for me in yours. 
I apologize for putting my trust in you. 
It never mattered to you.
Mostly, I apologize for letting you hurt and disrespect me.Heya,

I’m sorry I didn’t recognize how important you are to me until just recently. I’d like to blame the fact that I’ve been wildly unstable for... well my whole life I guess, but I hate when people blame their mistakes on anything other than themselves. So I won’t do that. You have been the most impactful person in my life. You make me think. You take me as I am. Even at my worst I was able to hold myself up enough so that the burden of me wasn’t put entirely on your shoulders, but that doesn’t mean the load wasn’t great. You handled it like a champ. Thank you. After years and years of effort, I’ve finally found my solution. I’m trying so hard to make sure that never happens again, but I can’t promise that. I don’t know if I can ever give you, or anyone else, peace. Maybe that’s not my responsibility. It feels like it should be though. 

Some of this realization is only intellectual though. It hasn’t hit emotionally yet. I’m sorry for that too. Others are still making me feel lonely, but I shouldn’t feel lonely knowing you’re in my corner, right? It’s so hard for me to tell. I don’t think I ever really learned how to feel things like a normal person and even with these meds I’ll never be normal. I don’t think that’s a bad thing. I just don’t know how normal friendships are supposed to work. 

The third part is quiet. Even if you’re listening for it you might not hear it. That’s because it’s mine. The closer you get the more you’re able to hear. It’s soft strings with heavy keys. It’s the deep thrum of my bass. It’s my low, slightly off key voice. But this isn’t a song for me to share. I’m sorry for loving you. Wholly and unconditionally. I know this happens to you too often. Guys get close under the pretense of just being friends and then get angry with you when you don’t reciprocate their feelings. I’m glad that you’ve been able to sort them out, stand your ground, and speak your truth, but I know it hurts too. That isn’t what happened with us. This is an accident. Something I didn’t see coming, but I should have. Maybe I could have addressed it differently and avoided this. In any case, I won’t be them. I’ll be with you like this for as long as you’ll have me. I’ll take care of myself in the meantime and work on filling that part of my life outside of our relationship. 

Even now, in a letter about you, I’m talking about myself too much. I’ve been too introspective for too long, but I’m finally in a place where I can direct my energy outward. I guess there’s a fourth apology there too.

To our adventures in life, in books, and through music.Is it? It it that easy? 

...You know, honestly? I don't think there's a way to deal with it. I made *so many* mistakes during that time period that eventually it's probably better to dump a liter of gasoline on it, light a match and call it a day. Mistakes, mind you, that I haven't even fully addressed to you. And when the situation is so far removed at this point, why even apologize? To alleve my own guilt? If the situation shows up at my doorstep and forces an answer out of me, I know what I'd like to say. Anything else though, is me just bringing up a couple-years old drama for the sake of spicing things up. And honestly, *I'm* the one that blocked *you*. Because EVEN when you seemed to forgive me, I couldn't take myself seriously. 

And don't you worry one bit - while it maybe not even take up an iota of memory to you, it still haunts me. Too many inconsistencies, too many mistakes by my part, only prolonged by a sprinkle of unfortunate coincidence. There's no hope in "letting go", there's no hope in the guilt subsiding. It's something to suffer by my own mind for as long as I go. I'm just not the kind of person to ever let go of this kind of thing.

I mean, if you want to hear it, then I'm sorry. I'm sorry a thousand times over. I have changed the systematic way I've approached people in similar situations to when I've found you. I have changed the ways I view those acts, and I'm ashamed for what I have said. I wish you knew what my feelings are, but I fear I will just open the wound again - and to be honest with you, I would STILL block you afterwards for my personal sanity.

It's strange, because despite all the awful experiences I have dealt with before and after you, my personal depression, my idealization of suicide, you were the one situation that I have felt the most remorse for. It's easy to understand why. It was the first real situation I had total control over, and I fucked it up beyond belief. 

It ironically is an apology you'll never hear, and it's the truest I can provide - by assuring that when in that situation, I can provide healthy advice without overstepping. Personally, I think I've mostly succeeded with the people thereafter, but really, the mistake I made with you taught me all of that. 

I am truly, from the bottom of my heart, sorry for what I said to you that night. I genuinely hope you're happy now.I don't know if there is a time or a place I will ever see you again. Somewhere I could tell you the truth, the whole story. About me, about what happened.


Maybe it's too late. The realization of this has been like a slow, sinking feeling. Warm, almost welcoming. 


It's sad. I'm sad.


... 


... So, the truth. If I can even manage it anymore.


I'm a lonely person. Always have been. I realize that now, and for what it's worth, I accept it. Like slowly slipping into a body of water, I convinced myself that I would always be alone, and, like becoming fully submerged, my dreams of a companion in this life were, too.


Until I saw you. 


Somewhere, deep down in my soul. All my hopes and dreams, reflected in your eyes. These feelings, I didn't know what do with them. I struggled to understand what it meant. Like a long lost childhood friend, you felt familiar, yet at the same time so far away.


...


... And as soon as I could even realize, you were gone. Only an image remained, your eyes haunting me, still. Life went on. 


Until one day. One fateful day. I saw you again. Older this time. Like me. Your eyes, deeper than before, but still very much the same azure depths that had haunted me for so long. Speaking in a language only I could understand. 


I confessed. I confessed my feelings. As best as one could, I did. At least I thought I had. You told me you weren't the type of person for a relationship. Those words. The very same I'd told myself, once again felt like slipping into that all familiar sinking feeling, only deeper now. 


Ever since that day, my life became a living nightmare. Every day, a struggle for survival. Every night, dreams of longing and betrayal. 


On the foreshore, the light from whence you came only seemed to fade deeper into the night with every passing day. Like a hopeless romantic in love with an afterimage. Only, I was no Gatsby, and you were certainly no Daisy. 


I destroyed my life gazing into those lights. Neglecting all but dreams of you. Waking up with my face in a ditch somewhere. Sinking deeper into the great bath of my own fractured mind.


... So, the truth. 


I'm sick. 


"Schizophrenia", the words still ringing in my ears. 


Does it make a difference? Could I have done something differently? Was there ever a reality we both occupied? My actions, were they mine? Or were they simply the chattering of a deranged mind? 


All I know is, I can never separate myself from them. Just like I can never separate myself from you in my dreams.


I once said to you that what I've done to you is my own greatest fear. I don't think you understood what I meant, and, to be frank, neither did I. Now, I do. 


The truth is, I still love you. 


And for that, I am eternally sorry. 



V.I’m sorry for falling harder than I thought I would. I’m not supposed to love you.

I’ve never felt so drawn to someone before. When I look at you my heart sinks so far. Knowing that you aren’t the one. 

I’m sorry for loving you so hard.I'm sorry I ever attempted to maintain a friendship with you.

What a waste of time that was.last night, you slept at her house. why am i surprised? i upset you late afternoon after trying desperately to make you happy, then made it worse by saying things i know i don’t mean. self sabotage is my best skill after all, and most of the time, it’s intentional. 

my sense of self is fleeting, my mind changes on a whim. i thought you knew that by now, i thought you would have seen what i meant by “you don’t want to be with me”. if it’s *this* painful to just be good friends, how do you think it’ll be if we were more? 

to be truthful, there are days where i consider the possibility of giving up on him and seeing how it’ll be with you. but as i said before, i’m not the kind to walk away. being alone is terrifying, and i know you’ll say “well you have me” and i’ll know deep down that you’re right. but what if it doesn’t work, what if i took all that risk at the most life-changing point in my life just to fail? i don’t like change, i don’t like instability, and i don’t like failure. 

what i meant by “it’ll probably never happen” is that i won’t have the guts to walk away, even if i wanted to. i can’t figure out how to make you understand that. my life has been chaos, ups and downs and being thrown off course so far it took months to find its way back. it’s fear, and it’s doubt, and it’s cowardice. 

so while, yes, i can’t say that i will end up with you, i don’t want you to sleep in her bed. you’re mine, even without *technically* being mine. just like i’m yours, without *really* being yours. i can’t stand knowing that you’re there, snuggled up under the blankets with her and not with me. but i guess what goes around, comes around.1.I am sorry I left.  I completely and utterly abandoned you.  I am sorry for doing that.
2.  I am sorry I found love and passion with another man and that caused me to withdraw from needing you.  
3. I am sorry if anything I did caused you to question your virility or sexuality or abilities or sexiness.  You were and I suspect, still are, a very attractive and appealing man.
4.  I am sorry that I have bpd and my mental health impacted you the way it did.  All I can say is that I was undiagnosed before and had  no understanding that I was manic or extremely moody due to a mental health condition at the time.
5.  I am sorry that sometimes, in anger, I spoke about you (anonymously) to others.  I sometimes described you in not so flattering terms- and what I experienced in trying to be friends with you- in not so objective ways.  I vilified you and I know that is something that bugged you.  
6.  Most of all- I am sorry that I caught feelings for you.  I tried hard not to and thought I would be okay because you and I were not each other's types IRL.  But you took me by surprise and before I knew it- I cared way too much about you.  I am sorry if that made you feel scared, trapped or anything.  I tried hard to stifle my feelings but sometimes it got hard when you were gentle or kind or loving towards me.  I did genuinely, and still do, care about you as a person and want you to be safe, happy and healthy.

It really sucks I can't tell you all these things in person.  I have an old email and a old cell phone number.  But barring the end of the world (and even then maybe not) I won't intrude on whatever peace and quiet you enjoy in your life now because I am not a part of it ...anymore.

The void your absence leaves in my heart creates a small but persistent ache that I bear as my penance.I’m sorry that your love for another country’s president far outweighs the love you have for your bi-racial grandchild. 

I’m sorry that anytime I try to have a discussion about serious social issues that will have ramifications on my sons future, you turn it into a bashing fest on my personality. Im sorry you just wish I could be happier. I’m sorry I’m not and don’t meet your expectations of a strong person. 

I’m sorry that you’ve never done any research on how depression affects my
Mental health, even after he took his life and left us.  I’m sorry he was your favourite kid and you’re left with me. I’m
sorry you think I blame you. I’m sorry that I destroyed every relationship with anyone who decided to blame you.Dear Ex boyfriend,

While you discard person after person and lie to yourself about a perfect love, I reflect on some of the people in my life.....

My Mother works herself into an exhausted mess, discarded by society and abused by past partners. She was abused as a child, her partner was violent when she was in her 20's and her last partner cheated on her and left her. She gave up on romantic love after that. She's been single 15 years now.

My close friend struggles to recover and move past the childhood sexual abuse they survived. They are single and strong.

My sister helps her best friend heal from cancer treatment. He barely survived and she was there every step for him. All the while, my sister is still nursing her heartache from a partner who left her for their alcohol addiction. 

These people in my life are wonderful loving humans. I cannot understand why they suffer, despite working hard to help others (they work in health care and social work) and they do so without the love and support of a romantic partner. 

They work on their own personal growth and to better society. I look up to them and I am thankful that I have them in my life.  I am not perfect, and I'm not nearly as strong as them, but I simply can't believe that you chose not to better yourself. You chose to move on, ignore all that happened, avoid accountability, and say 'I'm sorry for hurting you'. That's it. You forget the whole thing. 

You have ALL of the privileges, while so many suffer alone, and you still refuse to get help. You instead, pretend to yourself that what happened with me was my fault. When you apologized to me you didn't specify what for. Was it the lying? The invasion of my privacy to an illegal level? Pretending to love me romantically so I would stick around and take care of you? No, you won't admit to the details because you'd have to own it... and maybe actually feel sorry instead of pinning it on me.

So, enjoy your new relationship and ignoring everything you've done to hurt other people. 

You broke the last piece of me that was still in tact. I'm trying every single fucking day to rebuild.I am sorry. I mean the previous sentiment with every bit of me there is. Not that it excuses anything I’ve ever done, but I’ve grown more lately than you would ever believe. I’ve come to grips with the fact alcohol brings out all the demons I’ve fought with my entire life, and I’ve taken action about it. I do a lot of thinking these days, and I’ve come to some very important answers about myself and who I used to be. I placed you in a shit situation and continued to ask for you to look beyond all the red flags I couldn’t be bothered to pull out from myself. I want you to know that I will see to it that no one else sees my ugly side the way you did. I am the only project I care about anymore, and I’ll be damned if I don’t finish it. I wish you well, and I appreciate everything you put into us, I appreciate you. I’m sorry I was a pain, and I’m sorry I didn’t give you the me I’ve fallen in love with as of late. Mostly I’m sorry that you’ll never read this.Thank you for everything you said to me when you apologized. I’ve read the letter 7 times, knowing I can never respond. 

I had a dream about you last night. It had only been nightmares, for so so long. 

You were so quiet and you just let me hold you and cry and touch your face. I remembered how you smelled and what your hugs felt like. I touched your stubble and held your face. I still can never forgive you. But I accept your apology. I really hope you get better. 

It feels like I finally found my peace.Hey Ashley,

I hope you’re doing okay.

I don’t have a right to think about you, but sometimes I can’t help it. I have a lot of regrets as a result of things I have said or done in the past that I can’t stand. They don’t always eat away at me, but whenever I trap myself in my headspace, I inevitably start going over past mistakes and thoughts. I’ll linger on those thoughts, some of them from so many years ago. I go over countless hypothetical scenarios to think about what I could have done to be better. Of course, that just makes me feel even more like I should have made the right choice back then. All of these nasty thoughts act as a vortex where the bad feelings are perpetual and happiness is incapable of breaking through the barrier. Sometimes I’ll sit in the quiet thinking about those thoughts for hours at a time, and sometimes that means those thoughts leave me alone for a little while longer, but other times the next day comes and those thoughts come back, sucking me under the surface and threatening to drown me in the never-ending torture that is my own head. And then it happens again the next day, and maybe even the next, until eventually I find my way back to the surface where I can gasp for breath.

Comparatively, I’ve done worse things to others, and I always think about them, too. But for some reason, it feels like you’re the one I think about the most. The one I think about first. The one that I wish most of all I could go back and change.

Do you remember when we first really met? A lot of my memories are blurry, which might be part of why I try to relive the parts I can remember so much, even if it hurts. The first thing I can remember is us sharing some dumb computer class freshman year. Did we sit next to each other, or just close by? I’ve always been really insecure, especially when it came to girls, but we talked and became friends and eventually I started to have a crush on you. I don’t remember who asked who, but I remember that we dated for a short time. I think it lasted like a week, and even then it’s hard to look back and call it dating. We only really saw each other at school, and even though we were supposed to be together, I was too awkward to even hold your hand or kiss you because somehow I felt like it was still fake or you didn’t want it, and I definitely couldn’t find my voice to actually ask. I don’t remember who it was, but one day when we were saying bye to each other after school, a friend of yours had asked if we were going to at least hug. I’m sure I was an awkward mess, and in hindsight you probably weren’t much better.

The “relationship” only lasted like a week, but I remember that you were the one that broke up with me. I remember that you were born Christian, and for some reason I feel like I remember you citing the fact that I wasn’t as a reason for you ending things. I’ve never actually thought about the reasons for it, but now I can’t help but think if there was something else, too. I know I was insecure, but maybe you were, too. Maybe you felt like I was leading you on or something since I didn’t seem to actually want to do anything that even a high school couple would do. No point in lingering on the thoughts, I guess.

I don’t remember us talking a whole lot after that. We had mutual friends still, and I’m sure we shared idle chit-chat from time to time, but our friendship effectively ended. The next thing I remember about us is when two girls that were supposed to be your friends were cyber bullying you one night the summer before junior year. I was messaging them, too, but I don’t know if I ever even bothered to ask why they thought you deserved that kind of hate. Maybe they told me, and my twisted fucking head said it made sense. There’s no excuse or justification for it, but I chose to join in. I said hateful things to you, hateful things that I can’t even remember anymore. I only vaguely feel like it had something to do with you and your Christian beliefs, which was probably the best way I could think of to hurt you. You never deserved any of that, not from them and certainly not from some asshole who wasn’t even a part of whatever had brought it all about. When people call others monsters, it’s usually due to some heinous crime, but that one night of bullying is more than enough for me to call myself a monster.

I’ve gone back to look at our Facebook messages from all those years ago. You confronted me about my behavior, maybe the next day or a few days later, I have no idea. I was unapologetic. You said you didn’t understand why I said things, and my excuse was that I was just getting on the bandwagon. You told me what I said hurt, and I had the fucking audacity to say the truth hurts. As if that wasn’t enough, I tried to tell you that you let people get to you too easily. Like, what the actual fuck? It’s bad enough that I thought it was okay to bully you in the first place, but when given a chance to apologize even in private, I thought the correct response was to fucking *double down*? Every time I think about it I start shaking in anger. How could anyone possibly lack such a basic understanding of empathy?

That was probably the last time we talked for a long time. I know — I *knew* — how bullying and feelings can affect people. I struggled with my own problems regarding that, so I knew what kind of damage words could do. I forgot about what happened that night, and I even forgot about me doubling down, but I know you didn’t. I can’t imagine how much it hurt, and I can’t help but wonder if you shook with rage when you saw me in the halls.

A little over a year later, we had started senior year. I was following around a friend that was giving me a ride home at the end of the school day, and you two had lockers just a few feet from each other. I don’t remember talking to you much over the year before, but maybe I did and you just bottled up your response anytime I thought I deserved to speak to you. That day, though, we exchanged words. I said something, something I no longer remember, and you responded in a way that I obviously took offense to, because I brushed you off as just acting like a bitch. You responded by telling me that I was the one that gave you a reason to be a bitch. Thank you for that. That was a reality check I’ll always be grateful for.

You stormed off, and I know I watched you leave. I don’t know if I remembered everything immediately or if it took me a few minutes, but I don’t think it would have mattered. Even if I remembered immediately, I doubt I would have chased after you to apologize. I know I remembered shortly after, though, because I only lived like 5 minutes from school and when I got home I had to message you.

For the first time, I apologized to you. You even responded. You even thanked me for the apology and said that it was really all you had wanted since I never did say it before or even acknowledge that what I had done was wrong. You’re really amazing, you know that? I couldn’t have forgiven me. I know I couldn’t have, because I haven’t.

I tried to forgive myself, I really did. I can’t believe that I even had the gall to reach out to you after your freshman year of college. You held a conversation with me and responded thoughtfully when my name didn’t even have the right to pop up as a notification on your phone. That was the last time we talked, and it was over 5 years ago now.

I’ve thought about you a lot since then. About how awful I was, and about how extraordinarily kind you were to me despite it. I can’t forgive myself for it. I won’t let myself feel like I deserve that forgiveness. You gave me forgiveness, but I can’t help but feel like I got off too easily. I didn’t deserve it, and you gave it anyway.

Since that first apology, I’ve thought of apologizing a second time several times. Almost every single time I fall into that vortex and start trying to guess what kind of pain my hate put you through. I’ve even actually written the second apology before, but I didn’t send it. I probably won’t send this one, either, of course. I don’t think I deserve one more moment of your time. I apologized once, and I want to believe that for you that was enough, but it wasn’t enough for me. Because it wasn’t enough for me, it makes me feel like my first one doesn’t count, and that I need to apologize again. I think I could apologize 1000 times and I’d still never be able to forgive myself for it, so I tell myself that you’re strong and that it doesn’t keep you up at night the way it does me. I don’t want you to see my name and be hurt, so it’s better if I let it eat me up inside so that maybe I can hurt you just a little bit less. I noticed you unfriended me on Facebook. I’m not sure when you did it, I’ve barely checked it since graduation anyway, but I found out when I got on one day to go torture myself with my responses to you and saw we weren’t friends anymore. It’s probably the biggest reason I won’t bother you with another apology. Maybe it’s a sign that I should apologize again, but so far I’ve chosen to take it as a sign that that I’m totally cut off, and I certainly won’t be the one to argue that I deserve otherwise.

I hope you’re okay. I think I am.

Even though I can’t forgive myself for it, I’m happy to say that I’ve been able to learn and grow because of it. It’s a reminder to be better. I’m infinitely more empathetic now, and it’s helped me see the worst parts of myself and work on them overtime so that I can reflect on myself and actually be happy with that I see.

I’ve said it once, but I feel like I need to say it again. I’m sorry. I’m so, so sorry. I'm sorry for bullying you, for hurting you more when you were already going through way more than you deserved, for being incapable of understanding how much I had hurt you when you came to me after things had settled down, and for having the audacity to forget all of it even happened until you gave me a much deserved reminder.I apologize. Constantly. So I know it’s a little hypocritical of me to be mad every time I read your messages that say “I’m sorry,” but I just can’t get over the fact that you blame yourself. 

Especially after tonight.

You knew I was down, so you tried really hard to bring me back up. We talked all weekend about me, and how I feel towards another girl that I know. You encouraged me to try and see where she leads me, since, I haven’t been very motivated to achieve that whole “high school experience” thing everyone raves about.

Come to find out, she had a girlfriend already.

Oh well, all that I really care about is the fact that she’s happy. She never knew my real intent either, so I can just keep talking to her as a friend, which is plenty of human companionship for me. But ever since I messaged you and told you that she was in a relationship, you’ve apologized profusely. You keep telling me that you’re sorry for dragging me into this situation, when I myself couldn’t be more grateful. You tried to help me, and maybe there isn’t a pot of gold at the end of every rainbow, but it makes me happy that you really tried for me.

I’ve tried telling you this too, but I guess you’ll never understand. So please stop apologizing, ok? It’s not your fault, and it honestly pisses me off that you would ever get so down on yourself.But instead, I broke your heart.

Now, I sit here, and I think about you and how much I miss you and how much I wish things had been different.

We could have had a beautiful life together. We could have made each other happy and we could have loved each other, deeply. We could have had a lovely family with the sweetest children in the world. We could have chased the stars together, laughed together, cried together, danced together...

Yet now, I sit here, and I think about how I failed you. How you’ll never be able to trust me again and worse, how I’ll never be able to trust myself. I took everything we had - everything we could have had - and threw it away. Buried it deep into the layers of hopes and dreams now lost, a pool of memories that we almost had, could have had, but didn’t. 

And those memories that we did have, well, they’ll tear me apart. They’ll tear you apart too, I know. Everywhere I look I see things that remind me of you. They remind me of everything I loved about you. Everything that I lost when I shattered your trust. And I regret it so much. I can’t even express how much I regret what I did. But I can’t take it back. I just can’t.

All I can do is sit here, wishing I could’ve learned to love you better. I almost did. I almost did, until I didn’t. I didn’t love you when it counted most. Instead, I betrayed you. I broke your heart. I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry I lost everything. Everything we had. Everything we could have had.For doing what he did with your phone that night. Getting my nudes on your phone and you waking up to that. What makes you think I’m okay with this either.. I’m not a never have been. Yes I liked you but I wasn’t even talking to you. I was talking to your friend. A stranger.. so honestly I know you think I’m fucking gross I get it.. I am sorry for whatever the fuck I did that “hurt” you so bad. You are a hurting unit dude. Admit it. I’m not a fucking creep or rapist. You should have a conversation with a counsellor.

Hey friend,

How have you been doing recently? Eh, that’s a dumb question, us British people haven’t handled the pandemic well so presumably you’re as bored and pissed off as the rest of the country. I know I am. But I digress.


I remember when we first became friends at our drama group, that I had been having a rough time at school thanks to people bullying me over the fact that I’m dyspraxic and autistic and my cat being on the verge of death (and later passing away like 4 weeks later), and how quickly we formed a bond, and how you were genuinely kind and funny and caring and understanding. I’d never really met anyone that nice before, especially since you didn’t have any reason to be that way to me, you just were and I think if it weren’t for you I probably would have just given up acting altogether eventually. You had a lot of good advice for problems and whenever you noticed I was down I’d always get a hug, and I hope I was able to help in a similar way. I’ve not necessarily had problems with making friends in my life per se, but you were the first person I think I really valued as a friend beyond “oh there’s someone who might talk about Pokémon with me or something fun”. You also helped me both directly and inadvertently become a much nicer and more socially outgoing person to my older friends and helped me make newer friends so I’ll always be grateful for that. It was also great getting to end the year with the pantomime I’d written for the group and getting to see you show off your talent in one of the lead roles, and how supportive you were when I wrote it.

About half a year after we hit it off I noticed something...different about you. As you probably member when we first became friends whenever we weren’t making each other laugh we used to spend a fair amount of time telling each other about our mutual problems and yours weren’t particularly easy problems, but you seemed relatively on top of them. However, your personality itself seemed different and you seemed somewhat more on edge and you had more of a sadness about you. I initially just dismissed it as you “just having a couple of bad weeks” but as the problems grew I got concerned, so I took the opportunity to talk to a teacher at my school on a mental health day about your problems and they basically told me very firmly that I “needed to keep an eye on you”, which wasn’t the most inspirational or useful advice, but it gave me a purpose and something I told myself I would do, because I felt obligated to help in any way I could. It turns out for a combination of reasons such as autism and the fact that we only see each other once a week that I’m not always the best at “helping”, but I tried. If I noticed you were sad I tried my best to help you out, either by making subtle attempts at making you laugh or just asking if you were alright, which thanks to my autism didn’t always work, as I wasn’t exactly the most eloquent speaker in awkward situations and I had a habit of saying clumsy and downright stupid things that probably did more harm than good, and one particular incident led to me annoying you enough for you to get annoyed and even make me cry a little. I understand you never meant to do that though so I forgive you for that and I’m sorry for being absolutely terrible at trying to help you out.

After a few months you told me what had been bothering you during this time period and I was shocked at what I heard and I took it upon myself to help you recover in any way I could, and in a rare moment of success I think I genuinely helped. It was great seeing you smile again, but unfortunately it went into my autistic head a bit too much, which is where some of the real problems began. Oh boy. 

Another half a year or so passes and you seem a bit more down again, and a bit more distant. I told myself I wasn’t going to let you get hurt again, no matter what that would take, not knowing that I was way over my head in thinking I could singlehandedly cure your sadness with my magic powers. I was a stupid, clumsy, child trying his best to play the hero and I didn’t consider that you didn’t always need me around and I’m sorry for not realising that perhaps you didn’t need my help and for being pushy about it all. I was just worried.

Now for the worst part and the part I wish didn’t happen most of all, to the point where if I was told I could time travel to one point in my life to prevent something from happening it would probably be this. I’m sorry for losing my patience with you near Christmas time. I was stressed, I was tired and I stupidly misinterpreted something you’d said to me into something worse and I just kind of broke, for lack of a better word. You were right to call me out on my bullshit and tell me how terrible that I was being, you saw through it all and I know that I effectively stopped being your friend there and then, and I deserved to be shown the errors I’d made.  


After that particular incident I selfishly spent the last few weeks or so decrying 2019 as the “worst year ever” (haha I know) whenever anyone would discuss the events of the year with me, and while we’ve since been more civil towards one another when interacting and I’ve tried a little to make it up to you I can tell I messed up and that you’re still rightfully somewhat bitter (you’re only human) and thanks to the pandemic I don’t think I’ll ever get the chance to a) properly make it up to you and earn your forgiveness properly and b) say goodbye because I have to cut ties with the drama academy and become an adult. I’d love to be your friend again and if you asked for me to hang out or talk again I’d accept in a heartbeat but I have only myself to blame for fucking it up and er, yeah, I guess that’s the end of all that, and I don’t blame you one bit for distancing yourself from me, honestly if I was in your shoes I’d probably do the same. I miss you a lot and I hope you’re doing okay.


Take care of yourself and don’t let anyone, no matter who they are, put you down. You’ve got a super bright future ahead of you, and you’re bound to succeed. Coming from someone as cynical as me, you must be good if someone says that about you. Thanks for the time we spent as friends. 

From,

Your former friendIve kicked myself for every feeling of butterflies in my tummy and every glance that lingered just a little bit too long.
Ive beaten myself time and time again because I missed the point in the moment.

Honestly, I loved every second we spent together, my heart still soars when I see your smile. But I'm sorry I felt undeserving of your affection. My own humility, and my own lack of self worth drove me to refuse your attention, and I withdrew more because of it.

So i'm sorry.
I'm sorry I spent more evergy suffocating myself in doubt than smothering you with kisses.
I'm sorry for every time I wanted to reach for your hand and didn't.
I'm sorry for not telling you how I felt.
I'm sorry for refusing to acknowledge the possibility that I i'm not as unlovable as I believe myself to be.
Most of all, i'm sorry for not realizing that you may have felt the same way...

I love my fiancée, and I would never leave her side for the world... but I want nothing less than the best for you too.

In the of case you finding this before finding me again, know that I would love to be your best friend and confidant.
I still long to see your smile light up the room, and know that you are happy.

I hope you find your slice of happiness in someone that loves, cares for, and respects you as i have.

With all the love I wish i could have shown you.
-The ginger bearded fuck you used to hang out with.I'm sorry that I'm so broken.

I'm sorry that I think the worst of myself, and it's almost impossible to convince me otherwise.

I'm sorry that I hurt so much during panic attacks and you have to watch it happen.

I'm sorry that I've been so unbelievably sad.

I'm sorry that I let you down when you needed me.

I'm sorry that letting you in is so difficult.

I'm sorry that you have to deal with me.

I want to be better. I love you so much. It's always been you. I don't know how to make this rightI’m sorry that I put you in this situation. 

I’m sorry that I ruined a good friendship by overstepping my boundaries. 

I’m sorry that I continued to pursue you despite your requests to stay away. 

I’m sorry that I didn’t give you the space you needed to heal. 

I’m sorry that I projected my own fears onto you. 

I’m sorry for letting this all go out of control without dealing with things better as they were bothering me. 

I’m sorry for not communicating with you better. 

I’m sorry for putting you in awkward situations with the community. 

I’m sorry for not recognizing your intentions to help before things got worse.  

I’m sorry for burdening you with my mental health issues. 

I’m sorry for wrongly assuming I knew what your feelings and thoughts were without talking to you first. 

I’m sorry for not apologizing sooner. 

I’m sorry for being too much of a coward to be able to send this to you. 

I’m sorry for putting you through this all. 

I’m sorry.I can’t believe I miss you, after everything. Do you know how much I long to reach out to you? To see you, face to face, for the first time in what feels like forever.

God, I can’t believe how much I want to see you again. To just hear your voice would bring me some sort of twisted relief, even if it means you telling me off just like how I went off on you. I guess you’ve always been my kryptonite.

I miss you. I hate the fact that I miss you. I hate the fact that I hate you too, but I have to. You don’t deserve the space you occupy in my mind. The only thing you deserve is to be alone, but I know that you value being alone so much so that it’s what ultimately led you to pushing me away. 

Goodbye... unless we ever meet again.Please don't say how unwelcome this message may be.. I didn't want to say anything to you (for a while at least, I get that we live different lives and I know now more than ever how important that is).

Basically, I found a load of old messages I sent you, like from a year ago when I was angry at the world and really angry at you. I had this massive plan for us and couldn't accept that you wanted something else, and most importantly I couldn't accept that you were happy, that you were so freaking happy with how life had turned out for you. I hated you for it because I was extremely selfish and downright disgusting.

I hate that all. I feel sick reading back what I sent to you, and I just wanted to let you know how deeply sorry I am for ever talking to you like that. It was narcissistic, it was gaslighting, it was semi-abusive. No one should ever talk to you like that, and I'm so sorry that I ever did. I hope no one else has or ever will. I sincerely hope I didn't knock your confidence whilst you've been having the time of your life. And I hope you're still living your absolute best life with people who wouldn't dream of talking to you like that. No one deserves that, but especially not you.

There are so many things I've wanted to apologise for, but I've tried to keep the space between us (I know I've not been the best at that though, guess it just shows how friendly and fab you are aha). But when I found these messages I just knew I had to say something, because holy shit I don't know how you continued to be friendly with me after that.

You're one of a kind, thankyou for letting me me part of your life while you did, and I hope we cross paths one day in the future for just a while to catch up.

Stay wavey bro 
(cause.. waves.. on the lake...)I am sorry after loving you for over 25 years I let you down. We have always loved each other since we met when you was 11 and I was 13. I was crazy for you. You were my first love. The first girl i took out on a date, my first kiss, and the first girl to ever touch me. We never broke up I always got moved around. So we never grew to hate eachother and everytime we were reunited we were right back to were we left off. I left you this last time for a long time. I joined the Army and looked for you for years and eventually ended my search for now. After all the nightmares that a 3 tours to Iraq could bring and one nasty marriage all i wanted was to come home and find you. I called so many times and left messages with your parents to please call me. All i wanted was to come home and hold you and smell your hair. This time it was you that was moving on and gotten married and had a kid of your own. It broke my heart but I was so happy you found a man that made you happy. That day when your sister messaged me and told me she couldnt wait to tell you, was one of the best days of my life. I knew what was coming. And now here we are. We have made it through so many storms but I am still just as much as in love with you as I have ever been, even more to see how forgiving you are. But never again do I want to see that pain in your eyes. I dont know why I cheated on you. There is no excuse. I have been in so much pain that i hold in, i dont know why. Im not going to spell it all out but we know I have been through so much, and thats what also kills me. I know you have been through the worst of it as well, and the fact i hide behind that makes me feel like even less of a man. You are the strongest women I know, and I wish i had enough strength in me to look you in the eyes without crying and tell you this myself. I love my beautiful, free, always ready fly Jay Bird.I’m sorry I couldn’t be what you wanted me to be at that time. 

You wanted the attention that I didn’t want from you. I shouldn’t have delved deeper. It’s only left me more empty than when it first started. 

I can’t go any further. Not if I’m being shown that things won’t just go back to way they were before. 

I need you. I love you more than anything in this world. I want you. I want to be everything you want me to be. I want to spend my life with you. 

But I can’t go any further until I believe you want the same.I am sorry.

My behaviour was appalling and abhorrent. 
You deserved, and still deseve far better than that. You were batting well below your average just by taking pity on me. You were the kindest and sweetest person I had met. I repaid that by misreading you, overreacting, and having no inderstanding of how my actions directly affected you. 
I know there's no way to fix that, no time machine to go back and make amends early enough or event prevent it all from going so badly wrong, and no actions I can take in the present to remove that tarnish from myself, from how you see it or saw it.

I hope you oneday work past what I put you through and get to where you deserve to be, which is happy, free of anxiety and loved.

I doubt my apology will relieve any anxiety and stress caused or are still experiencing at this time. It won't ease my guilt or own current experiences, I hope maybe it helps one day in you attempts to work through it.

Apart from my child, you were the greatest thing to come into my life. I ruined it, i ruined the the best thing to happen to me, that was irreplaceable and now forever irretrievable. And I hurt you and your daughter, probably far beyond my comprehension of such things.

Thats a stain on my concscience that isn't going away. It will haunt me forever, I wish that was hyperbole but its a regular staple of my nightmares.

I do fear just even writing this could be offensive, as I have nothing you want or need. But, in light of the of the state of the world I have to own my actions, apologise for them, and do my level best to be better as a human. To work with my many flaws and grow.

I wish you nothing but the best

Sorry, always.To the only person I’ve ever really loved,

Hey, if I’m bothering you, please tell me and I promise you’ll never hear from me again, but I feel like I owe you a few apologies for the things I put you through a few years ago. 

I never told you how special you were to me. I never told you how much I loved and cared about you and what’s happening in your life. I never showed you or made you feel like you were the most important person in the world to me. Let me correct that, after the things I told you, I made you feel like you were the least important person in my life back then. That was so wrong and I feel awful for doing that to you. Doing that to anyone is so wrong, especially to someone that meant so much to me. 

I’m sorry for the things I said to you back then. I didn’t know how to handle what I was feeling and ended up saying a ton of stupid and horrible things to you. I know that’s no excuse for what I did. That’s no excuse to do that to anyone, especially the person I cared the most about. I acted like I was the victim when I was a murderer and I feel terrible for making you deal with that. I’m sorry it took me over 3 years to feel like I needed to apologize to you. It’s not right that I didn’t realize everything I did wrong until the end of last year. I should have known the problems I was causing you back then instead of recently. I guess that means this apology is late, just like I was for pretty much everything I was involved with you back then. So I’m also sorry for being late to everything, back then and now.

You probably think I’m a coward for writing this and for saying everything I did back then, but what you don’t know is that I think that when I tried reaching out to you nearly a year ago, that was the bravest thing I’ve ever done after everything I did to you. You also probably think I’m a self centered a****** for trying to talk to you after how I treated you and trying to catch up like I didn’t cause you so many problems back then. What you don’t know is that I’ve wanted to talk to you every day since then and its driving me crazy, but I don’t wanna cause you any more problems or bother you since you don’t wanna hear from me.

For those few years, I thought I was over you and my feelings of love went away. I was wrong about that. I thought everything I thought of you was in the past since I never saw you after all my screw ups. Once again, I was wrong. I thought I was done crying over you. I was wrong about that too. I thought I wasn’t still heartbroken over you anymore. I was wrong about that heartbreak. And for the record, you didn’t break my heart, I did it to myself. I broke my own heart over you. You didn’t screw up like I did. I know you weren’t perfect, but I also know that everything that happened was my fault. I did this to myself and I hope it doesn’t bother you the way it bothers me.  I hope you’re happy with your life now that I’m not in it.


I’ve been thinking about you a lot lately. I’ve been wondering how you’re doing now. Do you think about me from time to time? When I reached out to you last August, how well did you remember me and the things I did? Do you remember the things I did right or only the things I did wrong? Do you miss me every once and a while? Cause I miss you and I’m sorry for what I did to you. Do you ever think of texting me about anything? Cause I still hope when I hear my phone go off, every single time, that it’s a text or something or anything from you even though it never is. Not that you should care about that. I also wonder if you have completely moved on and am I forever in your past? If you have, that’s okay, cause I guess that means it doesn’t tear you apart the way it tears me apart. It’s just that it’s killing me to pretend everything’s okay on my end when the reality is that any memory of you from years ago is a reminder of how I screwed up that I can’t shake away from.

I’m not writing this because I’m begging you to be in a relationship with me. I’m not writing this because I’m begging you to forgive me. I’m writing this because I am hoping you’ll understand how awful I feel and how sorry I am. I’d love to tell you this to your face instead of writing you a letter, but since I haven’t seen or bumped into you in about 3 years, so I doubt I’ll ever get the chance to say it to you. It’s crazy to think there was a point in my life when seeing you everyday was normal, when now, I don’t think I’ll ever see you again. I’m guessing about 3 years ago was the last time I’ll ever see you, and I’m also guessing you’re okay with that even though I’m clearly not. I get it that you don’t wanna see me or talk to me anymore. I promise I won’t bother you with my apology.

I won’t bother you anymore.There are so many things I wish I could say to you. 

So many wasted moments and every moment that passes is another moment that nudges you away from me.

Are we already at the destination? Did we miss the journey?

Sometimes the journey is more beautiful than the destination.

Right now, the destination is unknown.

So this is goodbye for now, Not goodbye forever. 

I will see you again because sometimes goodbye is just the beginning.I’m sorry. It never should’ve happened this way but it did. In truth this is the last time I’ll apologize to you for existing. It’s not my fault that you put no effort into our friendship. You drove me to be pushy because I was under the impression that this relationship was necessary to my survival. That was my first and most fatal mistake. What was I to you anyway? Just something to pass the time until you could move along? I guess that’s what everyone is to everyone but even still, it’s not fair. At least if doesn’t feel fair. All of the time and effort we both used to put in. It was a lot of fun but it was hard to maintain, like any friendship. I just wish you had told me straight out. Said you didn’t want to be friends or you didn’t have the time. I could have respected that. But you broke me. And I’m not apologizing for that anymore. It’s your turn, and I’m not waiting anymore.I was the one reached out. I was the one who messaged first. I was the one who wanted it to keep going. And I was the one who messed up. I forgot to answer... just a single day had passed. I could've still messaged something. But no. I was scared, and instead of sending something, anything... I let time pass. It's been about a month. 

I opened a message and never responded, because I didn't know what to say. 

I'm sorry, God I'm so sorry. The funny thing is, I reached out to you because of how much fun I had that night with your friends. Just lounging around and laughing at every scene of 50 shades of grey. It doesn't really matter what I say now. That day ended and passed. One of your friends said I was one of the bois now.... even then I knew I wouldn't last. 

It never does. I'm just sorry I didn't respond. Good luck senior year; I can only wish you the best!

Bye NSHey...

**Let me preface this entire letter by acknowledging  how very unsent it will be. Obviously. However. I’m thinking it’s exactly the only way to communicate with you. And since I’m here. Doing this, I’m going for 100% honesty. With no worries about life. Much like the huge lesson you taught me, albeit not the biggest lesson you taught me, but a big one. Here it goes.**

It’s been so. So. So. Long since we’ve spoken. Which is incredibly sad. I hope you know that. It’s downright heartbreaking. I think of you still often. I find myself having moments where I wonder what your commentary would be to some of the situations I get myself into. Or what you’d do in this particular instance. How you’d analyze what I’m seeing. I wonder what existential connections you’d conclude. Your vision was so peculiar, and spectacular, and thought provoking. 

Your soul was exquisite. And purely unique. True and captivating. 

Please. Feel every word I’m saying right now. Because I can not fully express the sorrow that I feel for what happened—because there are no words that accurately encompass the sorrow I feel. 

I was madly in love with you. Truly. You’ve got to know that. You weren’t crazy. I felt everything I told you I felt. Every single thing. I felt like I had known you my entire life and then some. You had this way of seeing me for...me. Which ok I get it. Sounds so cliche. But its never been more true. See there are so many me’s I guess you could say. Even though we both know you must’ve come to this conclusion already. 

So here’s me, right? And I’m me, with a tinge of whatever the person I’m interacting with wants me to be. And that me, and their tinge become ___ . And everyone that knows me pretty much gets a tingey version of me. That’s what they see. 

But. You didn’t. You saw me. No tinges. Just me. You held me and I felt alive. Like my actual body vibrated. That your skin was electric and magnetic. When you made love to me, I was making real love with someone. For the first and only time in my life. You looked into my eyes, and unfolded my mind with your precise hands and I felt content. 

And I told you all that already. Many times. And many times I knew I fully trusted in another person my mind, body, and soul. 

And I left you. I did. And it kills me every single day. Knowing I hurt you. Knowing I made the choice to walk away. And the way I did it was so incredibly wrong. And hurtful. And mean. And I must’ve caused you great inner turmoil. I’m so very, very, very sorry ______. I’m so. Sorry. 

See I was leaving your house and I was stuck in traffic. I kept going over the incredibly small and meaningless interaction that occurred just before I left. And it was right there. This ah ha moment. Clarity. See, I knew right then I couldn’t be that person in your life. For you, or for me. And I cried. I balled. And cried. And was so angry with myself. For finding everything I’d ever wanted in exactly the wrong person. 

And I’m so very sorry for keeping that moment. And that conversation to myself. It wasn’t fair. And it wasn’t right. You deserved so much fucking more than that. I didn’t give it to you. And when asked my biggest regret in life, this is the moment I go to in my head. Isn’t that hilarious? You would be so upset with me having a regret. You wouldn’t tolerate it. And yet here I am. Without you, and regretful. 

And I deserve that. I deserve all of the shit thrown on me. Every last bit. 

But. Please do know. I loved you more than anything. And I never stopped. My heart still skips a beat when I hear your name. I still smell you in my memories. I can still feel you on me. I dream of you. I miss you so much it’s unbearable most days. 

Thank you so much for being you. And giving me the gift of you all that time ago. 

MeYou should've honestly left this e-mail in the drafts because you sound like the biggest fucking hypocrite in the world. I'm a piece of shit? You're literally using a fake story to attempt to ruin my life over what? Rejection? We're not in high school anymore, P. You have to learn to let shit go. This is honestly the worst thing you've ever done.

I'm glad that you are in a happy and healthy relationship. That's great. I've always wanted that for you and you know that. You are choosing to see me as this dirtbag that you knew in 2012. I'm older than I was back then. I've gained new experiences and new heartbreaks. I genuinely thought we could be friends after all this but you have proven that your friendship was not worth anything. You are a petty garbage human being and I want absolutely nothing to do with you or your "friends." Fuck the apology. I take it back.

You don't know the entire story, P. E is lying to you. E is leaving out important parts of a story that is clearly being twisted to fit a narrative to make me look bad. I'm going to drop it for now, but if I promise that if you go after me again, I will be contacting my lawyer and suing the fuck out of you and every piece of shit liar in your crew of degenerates.

There's never real consequences for my "behavior?" I fucking lost sponsors cause of you and E's lies. I don't know if it was you, E, or M or whatever fucking fake friend did it, but I genuinely hope all of you go to hell. Fuck all of you. You're all fake and I'm super glad I left all you to rot in Miami while I went abroad to do my dream job. For some reason, that pisses you off so much that you have to lie about consensual sex to make me look like an idiot. It's a dishonesty to actual fucking rape victims. You are the reason people don't come out. By all means, believe the lies that E is putting in your head, but leave me out of it. Think whatever you want of me behind closed doors.

You spent hundreds of dollars to come up here and coerce me into sex and sabotage my relationship when we were just supposed to hang out and smoke weed for a week straight. You're a fucking rapist. FUCK YOU.

You lost friends because you are actually a terrible human being and need to grow up. You're fucking 24, P. Stop acting like you're 14 and grow up before I show you what happens to grow up who lie on such a colossal level.

I was legit just trying to be nice to you and hatch things out but for some reason you took that as an invitation to ruin my life. You are the toxic jackass here. The fact that you could manipulate an entire community of people to thinking that untrue things about me is a skill in itself. I shouldn't be surprised. You were always good at coercing people and being overly aggressive.

Like I said, if you feel this way strongly, take me to court, but you won't because you know nothing happened the way that you think it did and I will easily win. Maybe you should try going after actual rapists like E's husband. You should go after actual rapists like A and J. You should go after actual rapists like H, O, L, and their whole team. Let E tell you about the story when she drugged R's drink with roofies and he almost killed himself the same night. Did she ever mention that to you? Probably not.

P.S. Fuck You CuntI want to sit on a counter in a sweater five sizes too big and pull you close.

I want to hold your hand in large crowds, not because I won’t be able to find you, but because I don’t want to split up.

I want to hold your bags while you figure out the next step.

I want to keep pace with you, even if it makes my legs hurt.

I want you to notice that my legs hurt trying to keep up with you.

I want to lean forward and eat the dessert from your fork after dinner.

I want to slide my plate to you to try a bit of everything on it.

I want to drink with you after working outside all day.

I want to stand still while you wipe the dirt off my face from when I wiped off the sweat.

I want to mess your perfectly styled hair just enough to break your mask.

I want to wake up 15 min before you and make fresh coffee.

I want to wake up after you and have fresh coffee.

I want to goof around with you and be truly, unashamedly silly without fear of judgement.

I want to have an answer when you ask where your jacket is.

I want to have seemingly meaningful nonsense conversations while staring straight ahead at something beautifully mundane, with just the right lighting to make it seem special.

I want us to end a day dirty, and then, let’s end it dirty.

I want to text you at lunch about nothing, and look forward to doing nothing, but together.

I want to go somewhere new with you, and then take you somewhere new to you.

I want to have no idea how to pronounce the food on the menu, but still laugh at your equally butchered attempt.

I want to show you how to build something.

I want you to show me how to write something.

I want to hear you read the words I don’t know how to say, and hear you understand them better than I do.

I want you to know me like I know you and I want to know you like you know me.

I want to skip ahead two steps, spin back on one foot and face you while we walk and talk.

I want you to catch my arm when I trip from trying to walk backwards on an uneven sidewalk.

I want to show you exactly how good I’ve gotten at improvising my way through shit.

I want to curl up with you under a blanket and watch bad tv adaptations of our favorite comics.

I want to show you something that interests you, instead of the other way around.

I want to understand what you do and why you enjoy doing it.

I want to help you when you need it and accept your help even if I’m too proud to ask for it.

I want to finally finish something and I want to see you start something.

Some day I’ll get to do all of this shit, but with someone else.

So, to the other one: Coffee?I mean I shouldn’t, right? 
I dont know what to feel. 

Part of me says, 
Yes, just move on since she hasn’t tried making connect with you over the last 7 months. She obviously moved on already. 
Every time you tried to say hi, all she ever does is block you. She left you without telling you why. She obviously hates you, doesn’t love you or never cared at all. 

But then the other part of me says, 
No, don’t move on. What we had was real and the things she said she wanted to do with me such as have a family one day or grow old together. Maybe I should wait for her a little longer. 

Lately, I’ve been feeling moreso to yea, it’s time to move on and forget about her. 
She hasn’t said anything to you for 4 months but more like 7 months since 4 months ago was only a few hours of talking before you said we couldn’t talk. 
She hasn’t apologized for the things she has said to me. 
I’m starting to seriously feel nothing towards her. My memories of her are disappearing. 

I dont even remember how she sounds like or looks like. 

I give up honestly. 
Nothing in the last 7 months has shown me that you cared or loved me once. 
Ive wasted my time. 

I’m moving onI miss you. I miss laughing with you. I miss bearing my heart to you and having you do the same. I miss getting to know the inner parts of you. I miss talking you through your troubles and hearing you lighten up while we sorted it out. I miss being able to hug you. I miss your hands on me. I miss texting you random crap throughout the day. I miss our intellectual conversations. I miss sharing music. I miss your singing. I miss planning adventures. I miss hearing you talk about things that you were passionate about. I miss cooking food and talking about God, life, our stupid younger selves, and what the future might hold. I miss our inside jokes. I miss the glint in your eyes when you looked at me. I miss being comfortable with you. 

But I don’t miss feeling like I was never a priority to you. I don’t miss the plans you flaked on, the promises you didn’t keep. I don’t miss hearing you gush over someone else, watching as you ditched me for her. I don’t miss waiting for the phone calls that never came. I don’t miss the unanswered messages. I don’t miss screaming into the void. I don’t miss your apologies and excuses. I don’t miss being disappointed, let down, pushed aside. I don’t miss feeling like that. 

If I were in the same position again, I would do it all the same. So I’m not asking to come back to you. Sometimes I want to. Sometimes I want to give us another shot. But then I don’t want to feel the way you made me feel towards the end. 

So, yes, I miss you. I miss you something terrible. But that doesn’t mean I want you back.fuck you for making me so fucking afraid everytime a man touches me. fuck you for making me afraid of men looking at me. of them raising their voice. of anyone getting upset with me. for making me feel so fucking bad about standing up for myself that i never do it anymore because you have created a male archetype that every man after you has filled, the ones that get upset when they don't like what you're saying and they flip it onto you until you're crying wondering what you did wrong. fuck you for making my first sexual experience an invasion of my soul, something that cracked me to my core. fuck you for making me feel inadequate even when you assaulted me, making me feel like i will never be satisfactory to any man since you were the easiest to please. fuck you for screaming at me, for cornering me, for gaslighting me and making me feel like the bad guy when i caught you in breaking me more and more. for making me the bad guy when you weren't loyal, replacing dishonesty for transparency. fuck you for lying every single day to me. fuck you for not caring about me. fuck you for being the first guy i let in that much, and fuck you for pissing all over what you saw. making it yours. making sure it's your face i see in my nightmares, your voice i hear when someone raises theirs, your hands touching me when the 3 other guys did to me what you did-at least they weren't sober. you were. you knew what you were doing. you knew you were breaking me beyond repair. fuck. you. i hate you. i hate you. a million times over i fucking HATE YOU. you raped me. you lied to me. you cheated on me. you made me into who i am now. you were the one who was supposed to apologize, not me. it should've been you who had to sit there while i was telling you how inhuman you were and it should've been you who had to explain what the fuck i was to you. i was never the bad guy. i was just trying my best. and i was blinded by you and your manipulative nature. fuck you. fuck you. fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you. you are the reason everyone after you is put off by what they see. you are the reason i feel impossible to love. you have tainted me. you have scarred me. you have broken me. you gave me trauma. and depression. and wanting to die more than anything else i want out of life. and the anxiety i feel that bubbles up in my throat every time another man comes close enough to touch me or speak to me. you are the reason i fucking hate myself. you are the reason i look in the mirror and turn away in disgust. you are the reason i lose touch with my reality, any reality you exist in is one i dont want to be aware of. you are the reason i find it impossible that anyone on this entire planet would actually want to be near me, let alone try to
love me. fuck you. you are nothing but a fucking nightmare and i hate you beyond words can describe. Hey, it’s Me. 

I’ve been wanting to send this for the longest time, but I’m not sure how it would be received.

We left on a bad note and I apologize. 

I apologize for all of the pain you put me through. 

I apologize for not being enough when you expected a young woman to know what she wanted while still yearning for your desolate touch.

I apologize for giving my innocence and all of myself to You. 

I apologize for getting my hopes up. 

I apologize for when you cried the first time you entered me, coming to Jesus knowing that this woman deserved better than Your meaningless insertion. 

There is one thing I will never regret - You leaving me. 

You painted me to be a shell of a woman, not capable of living up to the expectations you set for yourself. 

You were right, I was not ready. 

Now after breaking me down, Your disapproval has fueled me from within to be all the things You could never be. 

You will never be brave.

You will never be vulnerable.

You will never feel the warmth of being in these caring arms. 

You will never know the strides I have made to be the woman you always wanted but was too cowardice to love.

You will never be able to call me up late at night again hypnotizing me with promises of your love.

And above all, you will never know what it would have been like to be with Me.We are never, ever, ever, EVER going to talk again unless you apologize. And not that ONE apology you gave me that ONE time about "not trying to understand me better"--that's not what you did. I want you to apologize for the stuff you actually did, not some sugar-coated version that relieves you of accountability. You didn't "not try to understand me better" you actively projected your worst fears onto me and painted me as a villain in your head, and then treated me like someone who wanted to hurt you. That goes beyond "not trying to understand me better." If you're unsure about the impact your behavior had on me, you're going to have to

ask,sit down,and listen.

It's not going to be a five minute conversation where you apologize for something you don't even understand. We aren't going to pretend this is okay. NO. This hurt ME, it hurt YOU, and WE need to talk about it so that WE can heal and learn from it.

I'm not initiating the conversation.I'm not gonna be the first to share my feelings just so you can shut down and say nothing in return.I'm not gonna hold YOUR hand through a tough conversation as if you're the only one on this planet who's scared. You're scared so my feelings don't matter? That's how it works? You get to treat me like shit and it's okay because you're scared, and I'm? What? Your personal punching bag? Do you think I am fearless and that when people treat me badly it doesn't affect me?

You seemed to think that I'm some kind of courageous valiant deity who is excellent at communication and strong enough to take your bullshit. NO. I was scared as fuck. I learned my communication skills from PTSD therapy because of all the trauma I have been through--not from a happy loving family. In fact, I would even say I was as scared as you. I continuously faced my fears with you. I want you to take vulnerable risks in conversation, because I want you to see first hand how fucking SCARY it was for me when I was trying to start conversations with you about stuff that was important to me and you would cut me off mid-sentence, tell me you didn't care, tell me it wasn't important, or try to change my mind.

If you ever, ever, ever want me to talk to you, if you ever want to have a real interaction with me EVER again, that is what you are going to have to do. There is no sweeping under the rug. There is no letting bygones be bygones. I have to deal with the pain of a situation that \*you\* put me in because you did not take the time to repair the damage you caused.Do they ever feel remorse for what they’ve done? Am I going to be sitting in my deathbed, hating myself for waiting for an apology that I’ll never get?Now that I'm with somebody else, I look at us in a more calm and rational State of Mind. I don't love you. I also don't hate you. you are not a bad person. The decisions you've made we're very conniving and selfish. Nobody's Perfect though. Anyway, I will see you in court. if you knew me now, You wouldn’t even know I’m the same person that you couldn’t stand last year.  All the things about me that you didn’t like and brought to my attention during that conversation we had after the beer festival- I took to heart. Even though I deleted it, I still remember that conversation between us Word for Word... because each of those words came as such a shock to me. Even though you apologized after and told me that I didn’t have to change, I spent months working on myself and addressing every single criticism you had given me that day. You were right about everything. I’m truly not mad at you for being honest with me about why you couldn’t stand being around me anymore. When you told me how you really felt about me, how negative and self absorbed I was, it was so so painful to hear... but hearing it come from you turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to me. I was in a dark dark depression for 10 years and I didn’t even realize how bad it was because I was so used to living that way. More importantly, I  didn’t realize how my words and behaviors affected the people around me Until you said something. That’s why I decided to change. Throughout my entire adult life, I knew I was depressed, and I accepted that as my fate. Learning from you that my depression was hurting the people around me who care about me, however... THAT I could NOT accept. 

That conversation with you forced me to look at myself and look inwards and finally be honest with myself about how truly Ill I was. I got help. I got the right doctors I got the right medicine, and for the first time in my life I know what it means to be happy. I never knew happiness...  I never knew stability... all I knew was how to fake a smile, drink my problems away and do whatever I had to do to just survive another day, either that or just sleep all my days away. All those times I canceled plans on you I honestly just couldn’t get out of bed that day. It doesn’t make sense now… It probably doesn’t make sense to anyone who hasn’t experienced clinical depression. I’m so sorry .. I was so stuck just trying to survive that I didn’t think about anybody but myself. I’m sorry I let you down so many times.

Now that I’m OK, it makes me feel sick knowing that I Lived my life that way for so many years and that I was so selfish and inconsiderate Towards the people around me. I was so oblivious when you knew me, I had no idea that my negativity was a burden to others. I took my friendships for granted, I took YOU for granted. You were always there for me, you always listened to me, you tried to help me .. but I was so stuck in my dark hole that nothing you did or said mattered. I can’t imagine how frustrating that was for you And I truly am so sorry. I’m glad you finally said something, even though it hurt me and ended our friendship, because It forced me to open my eyes. I learned how to truly appreciate and be better to the friends that did stick around me after that dark period of my life. I understand why you don’t want to talk to me anymore. And I’m OK with that. What I’m not OK with though, is you never knowing how truly sorry I am for everything.. or you never knowing How truly grateful I am. I know it sounds cheesy… But you really did save my life by giving me that reality check. I just want you to know how much it means to me. I’ll be fine if you never wanna be friends again... even if you did, it probably wouldn’t be the same. And maybe that’s OK. We don’t have to hang out, but maybe we can just respect each other instead of avoid each other... or Maybe you can unblock me on social media and we can follow each other  again and be happy for each other’s life accomplishments lol I don’t know… I’m just throwing ideas out there. 

it’s hard for me to accept that we are practically strangers now,  despite all the years we’ve known each other... but if that’s what you want I can and will accept that. I don’t expect anything from you after reading this, I just needed you to know my apology.I fell in love with the way you made me feel. I didn’t reciprocate it, and it was too late when I realized I never gave you enough. You made me feel seen, loved, special, extraordinary. I never took the chance to tell you that you are all of those things and more, and I just can’t forgive myself. I told you I loved you but never told you why, and that’s important. I see that now, but I’m afraid I’m just too late. You weren’t wrong for giving up on me. I just wish I’d given into you more. I love you for all of the amazing things you are, not just all of the amazing things you made me feel. I’m sorry, for what it’s worth, for loving you so selfishly. I miss you so much.You were so sweet, we really were best friends and I valued our friendship so much. You'll never know how much I valued it. I always felt like the outsider of the group and felt like I was imposing myself on all of you because I didn't know many other people there... but you sought me out and actively made me your friend. 
On that night, when everyone was drunk and happy, and you pulled me aside and told me how you really felt, I didn't know how to react. We kissed and it was perfect, but I just couldn't do it. There were so many things you didn't know about me, you didn't know how broken I was. I didn't want to be the one to take your virginity, in some way I don't think I felt like I deserved it. 
I had a shallow crush on somebody else , and I gave you a shitty excuse about not being ready for a relationship. I wasn't the person I am now, I hurt you and I'm sorry for that. You hurt me too though, you didn't want to be my friend if I didn't want to be with you. 
I see the man you've become and I really am proud of you (I'm cheering you on from a distance), but I can't help feeling a little sorry for myself. I don't think you realise that if I had said yes to you back that, my life would have taken a completely different path. I don't regret the path it did take, but I sometimes wonder what would have happened. 
I think if I had paid more attention to you and kept in touch over the years, then maybe we could have had a second chance, but now you're getting married to a girl who looks a bit like me. 
I guess I just want you to know that I'm sorry for whatever pain I caused you, I'm sorry for making you cry. I was too young and stupid to see how amazing you were. You look happy now and I'm glad for that.K, I’m sorry that I assumed so much about you and treated you like my assumptions were true.

I’m sorry I got resentful and treated you like shit. If I had just talked to you, it would have saved me a lot of resentment, which would have saved you a lot of heartbreak. I regret not just using my fucking words. I got everything so wrong and you didn’t even know what was happening until you were hurting too much to have the conversation I should have initiated months before.

I’m sorry that I wasn’t accountable for my behavior. It’s not your fault that I didn’t apologize, it’s not your fault I treated you like shit—that was all me, I made the decision to do all of that and you didn’t deserve it.

I’m sorry I made you do all of the vulnerable work. I was so busy thinking about myself and my own fears, I didn’t even consider that you were doing all the brave communicating I should have been doing—even though you were just as afraid as I was. I didn’t consider you could be afraid. I didn’t consider you were human and therefore it’s impossible to predict things about you. I dehumanized you.For anything. Ever. That's probably a lie. Im drunk and full of flowers, rainbows and sunshine. But never anything trivial. Never anything that NEEDS to be said. Im not a snowflake, love. I can handle it. Please, just be honest with me.You don't have good boundaries, so you don't even realize how rude I was, or how badly I messed up. I can't just say that it was wrong that I let us become close friends because that is confusing and you aren't responsible for that. I do not want to overwhelm you with my guilt but it's not like I am walking around like normal after hurting your feelings like I did. I haven't been able to do homework, eat, or talk to my friends. I am filled with remorse, and I hope you don't think that I wanted any of this to happen. I really, really messed up. And there's not much else I can do about it. I want to delete all of my social media and just forget any of this ever happened but that would be running away from it. I am trying really hard to take this head on. I am scared to send my apology note to you. I am scared that you want revenge. But please understand that I am trying to make things right. My morals have finally returned to me and it is horrifying and it is freaking me out and I wish I wasnt dealing with this alone. I'm so sorry.Dear friend, it’s been over a decade and the regret I feel at not meeting you to celebrate being done with finals still haunts me in the most surprising moments.  I chose to spend that day drinking instead with people who are no longer in my life. I think about your texts asking where I was and I get so sad. I’m sorry for letting you down. 

We still talk every once in a while, but I wonder a lot about what if....what if I had gone? Would our relationship have changed that night? Would all of the things we share in common and our ability to talk to each other for hours about anything have led to love? 

You were so hard to read sometimes, because like we discussed once, if you weren’t sure the other person was all in, you were hesitant to express your feelings. I just want you to know, I would have been all in with you. 

My life is a happy one now, and I hope yours is too. I pray that whoever you end up with knows how wonderful you are and loves you the way you deserve.I’m sorry to my neighbors if it ever smells of weed. If I ever get enthusiastic with the guitar, even though I barely play and when I do, I close everything so you don’t have to listen.

I’m sorry to my friends for taking so long to answer. For not being there when I wish I could. For getting caught up in my own anxieties and disappearing for hours or days or weeks. For having so much trouble visiting.

I’m sorry to my sister for not being there, and not having done anything to get close. I’m sorry for the things you saw when you were little and I was a messed up teen. I’m sorry for the bad influence and everything that caused you pain. I’m sorry for writing this here instead of telling you.

I’m sorry to my parents for not being the person they would have liked me to be. Someone that’s happy and love themselves. Someone that can function and they don’t have to worry so much about. I’m sorry for not being able to give back. I’m sorry for all the pain I caused you. I’m sorry for trying to kill your daughter some years ago.

To myself, I’m sorry for feeling sorry. For making everything so hard. For the damage and self harm I did in the past. For still not knowing how to take care of you. For thinking your illnesses make you less worthy of everything. For the high standards. For allowing you to think you’re doing this to yourself. For pushing people away. For thinking you’re gross or ugly, that you don’t deserve anything good because you’re a waste of space and resources. For not recognizing the work you are doing and the effort you put into it. For diminishing your talents. For not embracing you and loving you, and being proud for getting this far.I just want you to realize that you’re a piece of fucking garbage for how you treated me and left me hanging with so many unanswered questions and feeling the lowest I ever felt in my life. Fuck you.What was meant to be a unsentletter, spiraled...

&nbsp;



Curiosity raised,

Desire lit

Wandering thoughts...

Keenly they’re aware — my mask was evident

Think they notice *every* bit?

The language of your body:

Speaking vulnerability, confidence, dominance?

Sitting legs splayed

Wandering eyes, I want.

Oh no, they definitely noticed.

No, stop, I may hurt too many.

Plus, I’m undeserving.

It’s all so foggy

Breath hot and heavy.

Stop breathing so you can see?!

Did they just promise safety?

What do you want from me?

Do they see?

No they can’t possibly,

Shrink smaller, the thoughts will shrink too?

&nbsp;


Dreamt of you in my bed?!

Bewildered you hit that depth in my head.

Haven’t had a dream like that in a long time.

Intimidation and interpretation.

One intense look and I’ll be done.

Oh fuck me, I want to...

&nbsp;


Avoid eye contact!!!

Only listen to voice

But wait, was that the word shower?

Oh fuck, now thoughts wander.

Maintain avoidance of eye contact!!

But, oh look, a bed...

Visions of us under sheets in my head

Definitely turning red.

Nope not working!

Only option now is eye contact,

Pretend to look without looking?

Licking lips, oh shit.

Are they trying to undo me?!

Yes, yes they fucking are.

No, they may just be hungry for, hmm... food?

&nbsp;


Another dream, are my desires this extreme?!

Maybe they desire me too?

Definitely not anymore,

Disappointment pervade in place

As what more could they do!

They gave the power, remember?

Foolish, they offered plenty!

&nbsp;


Stop it with the mask!!!!

Playing naïveté only bodes to it.

They’re most certainly deserving!

I must clarify.

Quiet the voices.

Balance yourself.

Not just all internal,

external.

&nbsp;

Go apologizeOne of the repercussions of loving you as completely and unconditionally as I do is that I hold you to a standard of perfection. I think so much of you that I expect you to do things the perfect way. I don't see things the way they really are. It's almost like I see you as some personification of a deity or God. When I look at you, I don't see anything that could be interpreted as negative or sub-par. I just see what I believe is the best person I know.

Whether it's the way you walk or wipe your eyes when you're tired. Whether it's the way you breathe steadily or the way you smell when you've went a couple days without a shower. It doesn't matter, really, because whatever it is that you do, I'm going to love it because you did it. Does that make sense? That's why I want you to know that no matter what, I'll stay by your side.

I know you well enough to know how you think and how you operate. I know the subliminal messages you send and the things you wanna say but don't. I know you really are the best person I know. Even though you may not meet anybody else's standard of a perfect person, you continually meet mine and so much more.

I think this is why I get so upset sometimes. Because I feel like I'm not good enough for you and I can't comprehend why. I wanna be your best friend more than I want literally anything else in this whole world. I want to be the person you can depend on for anything. I want to be special to you, the way you're special to me. I like to be shown I'm more important than others, and that a part of you wants to take the time to show me I'm your best friend, too.

In having this kind of outlook and attitude, it's easy to forget that you're a person, too. You get sad, mad, scared, and worried just like anybody else. There are times when you come to me because you know I can pick you up when you're being knocked down or overwhelmed. I don't expect you to be in a vulnerable position because in my mind, you're in complete control of everything. I realize I'm wrong for doing this, but I just can't help it. I don't want you to ever feel like there are these unrealistic standards and expectations you have to live up to to please me. I promise that whether you win, lose, or draw I'm going to be just as happy and proud of you for doing whatever it is you did.

There's no right or wrong ways of doing things in my eyes. As long as you do what makes you happy, then I will ultimately be happy. So do not feel pressured or like you've got to be someone your not. Doing that is what would cause me to be disappointed. As long as you're being true to you, and doing what you know to be the right thing, I'll never be upset with you. When I say that I just want for you to be happy, I sincerely mean that. Plain and simple. Happy you equals happy me.

I'm sorry for making it seem like you have to try to be someone you're not. I don't realize that I'm doing that. No matter what you do, I'll never leave you to be alone and scared. You can always depend on me to have your back and be the very best friend that you deserve. In my eyes, you deserve the world. I'm going to keep doing my part in making sure you get it, too. For that's what makes me most happy. Hearing your laugh and seeing your smile are how I get paid. And I've never been as rich as I am right now. Thank you for being the best to me. You'll always be my number one. Forever and always. Love you.One will leave you waiting , all ready for your date, for 2 hours, after a hard work day without as much as giving you a heads up he'll be late, no apologies, just excuses. Time after time, argument after argument. He'll fight with you and blame you for everything, make you feel worthless, guilty that men are interested in you, tell you that YOU make him want to kill himself when you confront him about his cheating and lies, make you depressed and make you want to be single forever because he made you believe you're the worst girlfriend and person there ever was.


And then there's men who'll catch a 7hr flight, rent a car and drive for 7 hours to spend a weekend with you and your family. He's trying to learn your language so he can talk to them, he's buying presents because "it's rude to show up empty handed" and make you laugh with tears.
He's your partner and this might not be a forever kind of thing, but this man saved your life, raised your standards and made you love yourself for who you are...


I wish I could give him the world.I wish I knew what I was doing was hurting all of you. It makes more sense now why you all left without saying goodbye. I made you feel irrelevant, not appreciated, undesirable when we were all looking for the same thing. I wish someone told me long ago but what's the point when all you see is someone who never cared. It seems that the world has to come crashing down to make someone finally realize  they need to change. Learn to understand what they never understood. To change things that they never knew existed before. That person has come so far in so little time. I have faith in them and would be proud of the effort they are making to be more.  They have amazing resilience to have made it this far. One day I would like to see this person and the positive influence they created where once they cause chaos.Message received loud and clear. I'm sorry it took so long. I just need to make sure I don’t leave anything unsaid. 

It looks like you’re cutting me off for good. I don’t think I deserve it but I know you’re going through a difficult time. 

I was hoping I could be someone you could lean on to make you laugh and escape things for a while, but you need the space. Just know how special you have been to me. Despite the shit hitting the fan now, I’m glad to have met you. 

I hope you reach out again one day to reconnect when things get better. Never hearing from you again is a really fucking hard pill to swallow. 

But I won't hold my breath.

More than anything, I really hope things get better for you. You deserve everything you want out of life, and I sincerely hope you get it.

Just know if we never speak again, it wasn't my choice. Whatever happens next is entirely up to you. 

Maybe in another life we’ll get the time and place right.I forgive you, I know you don’t need forgiveness or you never asked for it but I still do. It’s long overdue because I’ve been holding onto this for too long.

I do want you to know though that you hurt me when you didn’t mean to, I was going through something at the time and I was trying to escape that hell and walked in to you doing the same to someone else and had to relive everything but from a different view.

I can’t blame you for the way I feel because you weren’t trying to hurt me. I took offense to something that wasn’t done to me.

I guess I’m a way this is my way of moving on from the way I felt about you and to try to become a better son to you mom.I cried when I read your message and as I write this letter I’m crying again. All these tears have to be for something, right? 

You messaged me when I needed you most.  You told me to get away from him, I already had but you just saying that confirmed my leaving was a wise decision. I have heard of physically abused women having a difficult time leaving, but I was being emotionally abused. 

You told me he needed professional help, something I had thought as well. I had asked him about mental illness in his family, sharing with him my struggles and that of a schizophrenic cousin. I loved this person, and wanted to share every aspect of my life with him, even the ugly. I wanted to know every detail about him, even things that were less than flattering. 

You told me people in his mental state will lie, he had already lied, it’s why I left him. He says cruel and mean things to me and others and just moves alongs as if it’s their problem. He’s incapable of a true apology, it’s not in his nature to recognize the pain he causes others with words. He never apologized to me, which is ironic, because an apology on behalf of him is why I contacted you in the first place. I felt so bad for the words he said to you, how rude and mean he was. You saw the side of him I had. You understand my pain, although a huge difference is you didn’t love him like I did. I wanted to give him everything his heart could desire. I felt for him the  way I know my new lover feels for me. It feels good to be so wanted and desired, I guess my want and desire was not enough for him.  

I loved him, I hate that about me now, it makes me feel stupid. I feel stupid.  

Your words meant the most to me at this point, when you said that just reaching out to you,  to apologize for how he treated you, showed what kind of person I am. You called me kind and nice.  I cried so hard at this point because that’s what I want to be. Thank you for reminding me that I still am.Your love for me, it was too overwhelming.

I didnt know much about a healthy love love. Nothing, as a matter of fact. 

Your love was true. It was pure and as unconditional as love can get.

That scared the shit out of me. It confused me and made me uncomfortable.

It was too overwhelming. 

I wish I had another chance to grow in love with you.

But we'd both have to be Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Minded, and that could never happen. 

There is no possibilities for us. Too much resentment. Too much sadness and hurt. Too much animosity and baggage. 

Besides, we've both moved on. Myself alone, and you with your new love.

But no one will ever be you.
And no one will ever be me. 

And no one could ever share the connection we had, and really still have to this day. Now we have to keep it under wraps so as not to create hurt feelings. 

I've done enough of that to last you a life time. 

I love you.I'm sorry that I wasn't enough for you, which feels like an odd thing to apologize for. Almost the opposite of accepting a compliment for the name your parents chose.

I miss you. Why do I miss you? I miss your dog. I miss your hands. I miss the pasta that you always overcook.

Maybe some day i'll move to the East Coast and we'll meet again at a grocery story and talk about how terrible college was. Or maybe we won't.

I miss you dude. I hope you're so happy climbing mountains in Montana. I hope you find peace. I hope you don't hurt other girls on accident again. I hope you find closure and learn to love yourself again. I hope you learn how to cook pasta too.I wish to be as happy as I was with you. Since the happiest days of my life we spent together. What I wouldn’t give for one more of those days.I want to break up with you. Not because I don’t love you, but because I can’t handle the mental and emotional stress you put me through. You’ve been stringing me along for months and I allowed it because I believed all of the pretty things you said. We want the same things... but I don’t think you actually want those things with me. I just feel like a placeholder if I’m honest. My time and my feelings don’t matter to you because when I call you out for being inconsiderate of those, you go days without acknowledging my existence. As if I’m the wrong one for having my feelings hurt by your actions. 

I don’t want to break up because I don’t want to lose you or the happiness I know we could have... if only you’d communicate more and apologize for recent events. If only you’d seek the help you need for your own problems that I can’t fix, no matter how much I wish I could. I’m fixing mine and trying very hard to be the person you need and deserve.. but I can’t afford to lose myself in the process. I’ve already lost friends for you. I can’t lose me too. 

Please mean the things you say and show me that you really have feelings for me and truly want to be with me... because my heart can’t take much more of this uncertainty.Hey you.

If I could only tell you one thing. It'd be an apology. I was afraid. I was afraid of the world. I was afraid of being embarrassed. I was afraid of being wrong. I was afraid of being a failure. I took it out on you. I didn't know I was doing that. I was just a scared nothing. An angry nothing. A terrified nothing. And without you, nothing. You were the kindest, most helpful caring person. I've wasted my life, Scared and unmedicated. You didnt deserve any of that. It's been so long. I'm afraid to look you up or write to you. But, I feel like we're running out of time. If I can't make things right, and I'm not asking for forgiveness, but it wasn't you. I was out of control. I was the problem. I was sick. Mental illness. You were so amazing and talented and smart. I was just a sheltered idiot. Our friendaversary is coming up. Try and remember something happy about me, okay? I was an asshole, but I wasn't your enemy. I want to say more, but I don't want to talk about myself. you know? You were truly loved even though I was a crazy person and gave you so much hurt.

I am so sorry rdfh11cHey,

I'm sorry I punched a hole into your life that day.  I'm sorry I crashed on your couch, and cooked your meals, and listened to your boring work stories, and fornicated with you between 1 and 4 times a week.  I'm sorry I took you on weekend trips up the coast, or wined and dined you; I'm sorry if you fell in love.  I'm sorry that one day I punched a hole out of your life without explanation.  

You were a good person.

\-The Kool-Aid ManI didn’t want to be like this, and you don’t deserve what I did to you. I lead you on, even when I knew it wouldn’t happen. I know we are still friends, but I still feel terrible for how I made you feel and how I did it. If I could go back and redo, I would make it easier for you, and I wouldn’t have waited so long. I’m sorry. I hope you understand that I really truly thought that I meant what I said. Just because I didn’t doesn’t mean I hate you though. I was very confused, and honestly still am. Despite the fact that you will never hear this or read this. I am sorry.

Sincerely, someone who made some mistakesI miss everything. I miss our late night conversations, and our daytime conversations. I miss our inside jokes, and our awkward pauses. I miss all the forgotten moments and the what ifs. 

You mean (and meant) more to me than I’ll ever admit, and for that - I apologize. I apologize for not telling you how I felt from the start. I apologize for leading you on. I apologize for not admitting to myself that I knew about your feelings for me before you aired them. I apologize for not responding to you for over a year. 

We’ve always been complicated, and I respect your decision for taking the out. I miss you; and I sincerely hope that you are doing well. 

👾I made a mistake; we shouldn’t be dating. I shouldn’t be in a relationship with anyone. But when confronted with the idea of either dating you or losing you, I couldn’t bear the thought of that second option. It’s not as though I regret it exactly, it’s just that I know this isn’t right. I do love you, but it’s a platonic sort of love. I would gladly do everything in my power to make you happy, and I try, but it never seems to be enough. You want something from me that I cannot give, and that kills me. It would’ve been so much easier to stay friends, but you made it clear that wouldn’t have been possible. I don’t know if I should break up with you, but I know I’ll never be able to go through with it.

I so desperately want you to be happy, but I’m getting more and more frightened every day that this will end in disaster. There are so many people I love and care about in my life, but you seem to want all of my attention and energy for yourself. I try to prioritize you, but it doesn’t feel fair. I don’t think I can ever allow myself to put one person over another in my heart, and I doubt that’s something you’ll ever be able to accept. This is why I try to avoid relationships. But all of this started because I didn’t want to lose you, and that still holds true. This might be slowly tearing me apart, but I see no other option. 

There are things about you that scare me. Your anger, erupting unexpectedly and viciously. Your cynical view of people and your lack of other meaningful relationships in your life. Your silences, heavy with emotions I cannot read. Sometimes it seems you don’t care or even think about me at all, and other times you act as if I am the only thing on your mind. I’m confused and sometimes hurt, but I know you are often as scared of me as I am of you. 

I don’t really know what I’m saying anymore. I think I’m just rambling. This situation has been slowly eating away at me for a long time, and I haven’t opened up to anyone, let alone you, about it. I just needed to write this down, for my sake, to get it out of my head and off my heart. I do love you, and I always will, but I should have kept you as my friend. That way you could have been safe. Things would have been secure and solid and simple. I messed up, and I know you don’t think I did, but I want to apologize anyway. I’m sorry. You are so special to me, and I’ll never abandon you, but I shouldn’t have agreed to date you.Hey. Im sorry i havent talked to you in so long. Its been a very long time. Im not gonna write much here bc im still annoyed, angry, sad, all of it. Im cringing hardcore bc i know i said some shit. I was defending myself too. Idk why you cant contact me. Idk idk idk. Is it the thousand bad times? Fear of us going through what we did before? Bc ill tell you this. Theres not a soul on this earth worth going through that amount of emotional pain for. There just isnt. 

Anyway, i realized yesterday that me just taking time to reflect, and, hastily and angrily, writing posts on here to let you b know how i was really feeling. Thankfully they didnt send. I was mad. 

As i was saying, its about a lot more than just us. Which, funnily enough, has me thinking about how far ive come. Im dealing with more than just you and i, and obviously youre living your life too, but it gets difficult bc youre more "comfortable" than i am. Im obv decent at what i do or whatever but i still havent figured it all out yet. Barely understand. Rationally, at least. So im dealing with that, dealing with this, i cant stop smoking. Even tho i want to (mostly.......). And dealing with THAT. Is enough on its own. Throw in yours and mine situation and its a fucking dumpster fire. 

I will say this. I did have you on a pedestal. I legit thought so many things and was wrong about 95% of them. I forgot you were a human, just like me. I didnt think my "analysis" of you was entirely... correct. I sensed you were different. But i also was stuck on my past and let that fear cloud my vision kind of. But then you told me your favorite book and rip me bc that was the day u sucked me into ur brain and i had no choice but to flirt back, to love back, to want back. If i knew everything i did now, i still would not go thru it bc it just wouldnt be worth it. 

You know ill always care about you. You know ill always have SOME feelings for you. Im just extremely hurt, is all. I know you are too and i need to apologize for so many things. I like you. A lot. And im gonna take accountability for my part bc even tho i was scared, i didnt have to threaten you.... im so fucked up over this situation jesus christ like what the fuck? 

Anyway,

Been thinkin ab you every second. As always. Our silences never last long anyway. 

Hope ur having a good day. 

❤️So I sent a text not too long ago before I left home. Perhaps you didn't get to read it. I'll repeat it.

I'm grateful that my time on earth has provided me enough patience and kindness to forgive those who have wronged me. I'm glad that I have enough respect for other people and life itself to apologize to them in the face of that, for even though I've been made a spectacle of and ridiculed by and for those who once called themselves my friends, and their friends, true or not, and others - I did and said things that were wrong, and told lies. I'm grateful for the fact that despite beating my brains and body with drugs and alcohol for 25 plus years, that I still look as good as I do. Most don't, and won't. I'm grateful that I survived all of that, and this experience, which absolutely did push me to the brink of suicide. I'm grateful that the day will come, possibly in part due to this, that the day will come when some will realize the gravity of things like that. Hopefully they will make some changes in their changes in their actions and thought processes, and perhaps I will have played a role in that growth. I'm grateful for having enough wisdom to know that most people won't have to experience the death of a child that they care about, and have their family, home, and identity ripped out from underneath them, making it easy for them to laugh at such things. That same wisdom also knows that most of them will come to know the feeling of watching loves get old and physically fail, then die. Some of them will come to know the depths and anguish of severe depression and addiction. A handful of those won't survive it, via suicide, overdose, you name it. Couldn't be me, right? Right. Perhaps those that are left won't find any of these subjects as comical one day.

I'm grateful to know that I'm strong enough to have withstood the invasion of privacy, insults, and psychological manipulation at a very low and weak mental point in my life as I have. I know that many others would not, and if that level of microscope were focused on their lives - what might be found? How would well they deal with it? Especially during a nervous breakdown at what addicts call their bottom, utterly alone during a pandemic? When they couldn't go out and do the things they enjoy, to take their mind off things in the ways they normally would, or meet anyone new - be that friends or romantic interests. I shudder to think, and am grateful that none of them will ever experience that, I don't think. I've said before that what has been called weak and pathetic about me in certain ways will come to be seen differently in the days ahead, if one were to reflect on it. I stand by that, especially for a few of those people. I'm grateful that I know the value of my loyalty, friendship, and love. I'm sorry that at least two others do not. It's a far more precious thing to squander than money, and I do believe that they will come to understand that in time.

In the words of some guy in some book of fairytales written about a god that doesn't exist ultimately designed to keep the masses down and a small few at the top of the pyramid - "Forgive them, Lord. They know not what they do." My own addendum - but some will come to. I asked a certain someone just a while ago - when does it stop being funny? I've asked for no reprieve, don't ask for one now, and expect none. It's fine. But if you've read this far, and I've provided entertainment for you for months now, perhaps consider doing this one small thing for me. I'll never know, and that's fine. It's not about me. It's about you. Try, for just a few minutes, to put yourself in my shoes. This living situation. The few friends, the family, what that situation is like. Trying to get clean in the midst of it all. Trying to remain positive, continuing to apologize and attempting to forgive all. I ask you again - when does it stop being funny? I'm Eric - who are YOU? \*tips hat\*i hate you for being right about me. always fucking right, aren’t you? i hate that here i am, shivering in the freezing cold, yearning for a warm embrace but not having anyone to give it to me. 

i ruin everything i have, somehow, someway. i destroy things. i am a being of destruction and i do not know if i will ever become a being of love, of light. 

i want to be good so bad. i do things with the purest intentions and find myself apologizing for the hurt it caused, confused as to how something i thought was good was so, so bad. 

i fear i’m losing the only good thing i have left. i worry if i don’t change soon, she will leave. i worry that i will only grow to hate myself more if i don’t. but i do not know how to change. 

who is going to tell me?I messed up. I know I did. You said you didn't want to pick a fight. I thanked you for that. But in reality I needed you to. It would have knocked the sense I needed to remember why I loved you. Why you loved me. I am mad at myself for how I treated you and made you feel in the end. I'll probably never get the chance to apologize. I'll probably never see you again.

I couldn't talk myself out of leaving. You tried but it didn't work. Maybe we weren't meant to be together. But fuck it still hurts. 

I heard you moved on. That's good. You deserve to. I hope she treats you better than I did. I hope she's everything you need and want. I hope she shows you what love is again. I hope you will want to have children with her and want to marry her the way you wanted that with me. 

I'm not happy. Not right now. I'm not with anyone. In case you wondered. I didn't want to be with anyone. I just needed to finally be alone. I needed that for me. But missing you, getting over you, letting you go is going to be the hardest thing I've ever done in my life. 

Maybe later on life will bring us back together. Maybe in another life I can try again and be better.

Until then....

You were one of the best things that ever happened to me. And I will always love you.I'm so sorry. We met in a time where I was in my lowest point in life, and I can't express how bad I feel for putting so much pressure on you. It was not your fault for changing how you acted around me, it was mine for behaving in a way that forced you to react like you did. I would have done the same thing. I am thankful for everything you did for me, and I will cherish all the good memories that we created in our better times.

(A bit of context:) I was severely depressed and dropped out of school. I only had one guy as a friend that would play games with me online (never met him irl) and that was the only thing that kept me going trough my days - that I atleast have this person to talk to. In the end I was acting so obsessive around him, I was mad if he was too busy to play with me even after a single day. He eventually ghosted me, blocking me everywhere. This all now lies a few years in the past, I've gotten help and am in a much better place in life right now. In hindsight I can now see everything he did for me, and how badly I treated him for it. I randomly saw him in a Game we used to play, but he blocked me after my first message. I hope maybe I can find some peace of mind just by writing it here, even if he won't read it.If you wanted to talk...if. I'd be open to that. I'd have to know it was you, I'd have to know it was real, I'd have to know it wasn't a spectacle. Not that I mind being a spectacle, obviously, I can deal with that, and most anything. Not that it's my favorite thing on earth, and I'm more accustomed to the shadows for the most part, but I know all too well how a constant life in them can make a life dark. Isolated. One's light hidden under a bushel, so to speak. I've said plenty to you, and at you, and I'm certainly fine with not talking as well - I've grown quite used to it - but if it's a format or setting that were mutually agreeable, I'd prefer to. I don't like how things are, how they were left, or weirdness, much less grudges. I don't want or need any more enemies. There's plenty left to say and explain on my end, but that said, I've also gotten enough out that it's cool if this is where it's left. I know better than many about how the closure we're left with is sometimes all we get. I don't pine for you, I do miss you in some ways of course, the person I thought I knew so well prior to last April - and perhaps I did know. Perhaps not, but I also fully understand how that street definitely runs both ways. I'm sorry that you had to bear witness to some of the ugliest depths I've ever sank to, and that you were a focal point of my mind when I lost it for a time. In many ways it was a perfect storm of terrible things that came together in my world and the world outside. I fully believe that without quarantine this never would have played out the way it did, not that it's an excuse, but certainly a part of the reason. 

You have no reason to fear me, now or ever, and you never truly did, though if you did at times that's my own fault. That's never an emotion that I'd have wanted you to associate with me, and if I caused you to, I'm terribly sorry and will never look upon that time period without regret and embarrassment for such. Almost every word of that was just me trying every tactic to try to reach out to you,, since no other attempt had been fruitful, but it was a monumental blunder that I am deeply ashamed of. There was only a very brief period that I ever truly considered any harm coming to you, and for what it's worth, I could have never carried that out personally, even at the peak of my lunacy, and never anything so severe as some of my ridiculous language implied, hand-to-hand, nothing more. I feel like such a piece of shit saying even that, but it's the truth, again, if there's any bit of value in it. I hope you knew me well enough to know that's just not who I am inside, and that I truly lost my mind for a time. All of that is behind me, never to return, ever, and that is a solemn promise. 

I do think that at times, and perhaps to this day, you were trying to help me some, perhaps through others as well. If not and I am crazy (well) then I don't mind living with that bit of craziness at all. I think I've come to understand a good bit of your reasoning for some of the things that occurred, and if right, they are pretty justified. I'd like a clean slate between us, and I would like the chance to look you in the eye and apologize for some of the horrible things I've said, and some mistakes I've made during the time I've known you. And offer you the same opportunity, without any raised voices or drama of any kind. I bear you no ill will. I'll be coming back soon, but the offer is on the table in a permanent fashion. I may not be as easy to reach out to as I am now, but you're resourceful - and you know where I live. Let me know if so, and if not, without a trace of sarcasm - be well, and good luck.You cheated on me with a boy and didn’t apologize. 

You knew what I went through with my dad and still chose weed over me and didn’t apologize. 

You led me on for two years and once we started dating you broke up with me a month later because you didn’t see a future and yet again you didn’t apologize. 

Why is it you never apologized to me?

What did I do to you that was so bad?

Who raised you to be a heartless monster?

Did you use me the whole time? 

I’m left with so many lose ends and question and no way to get the answered. 

I can’t even tell my friends I love them anymore I’m so afraid of abandonment. 

Congrats tho you ruined my future relationships wether it be romantic or not. 

Where’s my apology?I dreamt of you yesterday. It was the type of dream in which you wake up with a profound sense of loss that envelops you in a haze which is difficult to extricate from real life. Not that real life is much better. We’ve stopped talking, and I’m disappointed in myself enough as a human to know that it is my fault. I’m the one who forgot your day, and though there are times that I feel vulnerable and blame my genetic predispositions as I try to fight them, truth is, most times I succumb and wallow in it until I feel incomplete and incapable enough as a person to want to sever all ties with humanity. I want to say I’m sorry, but I’m too ashamed to apologize and too ashamed to start something up again when I know I’m not brave enough to follow through on us. I’m sorry I can’t be better for us.Dear You,

I’m sorry for the pain and grief and loss you feel, not just for your former love, but for your former family.

I have been a mirror to your lower self, not your highest self, and caused additional pain.  I’m sorry.

I... may not understand, but have compassion for you.  For you to act the way you did with me... the only thing I can imagine is a deep, incomprehensible grief inside.

I’m so sorry for your loss, and for the loss of the others who mourn with you.

Perhaps the one thing we can agree upon is that we are not a good match.  

We resonated last round only when I was placed under duress.  It couldn’t be real from my side because it was forced.  I had already learned what would happen if I displeased you.  But these actions, re-actions, are only a part of you.  They are far from the whole story.  They are not your identity.  You are much more than this.

However, I will not sacrifice myself to ease another’s grief, regardless of my feelings for them.

You are you, and I am me.

I remove myself from the drama because I seek peace.  Makes me think I shouldn’t be sending this at all, that this will just add to the drama.  The best way forward is probably silence and non-action.  

I just... still feel the need to share sometimes. I’ll work on that.  Sorry if this makes anything worse.  My intent is to apologize for mirroring  lower aspects and being so reactive, and to share that I see more of you than just those actions, even though we do not resonate.

I wish blessings and love to all.

MeHow could you be so heartless and cruel? 
How could you just cut me off like that? 
Led me down a path of false hopes.
Then humiliated me publicly. 

You must be seriously unhappy to behave like that but I didn’t retaliate because it’s just not worth it. 

I believe when you treat people badly it comes back on you in some way. Maybe you will get treated like that also. 

Ultimately we live with our conscience. I said goodbye to you peacefully and with love. I can look back with no regrets. It’s unlikely you can do the same.You were never really a big part of my life. You were someone I occasionally saw or hung out with. We worked together for a little bit, talked from time to time. But a year ago, you did a really shitty thing. You were homeless and you asked me to get you a hotel room for a night because you didn’t have a credit card, they didn’t accept cash, you would pay me back in cash the next day. So I did it. But the next day when we were suppose to meet up, you just ghosted next. I texted you so many times after that, and I never heard from you again. Until today. 

I was so angry with you for so long, but then you popped up on my snap chat and I added you out of curiosity. You told me about how you’ve been 90 days sober now and that you were sorry you weren’t a good person to me the last time you saw me. And for some reason, I forgave you within an instant. Maybe anyone else would have rolled their eyes or wondered “what do you want?” But I just didn’t. 

I want you to know that I’m incredibly happy for you and am so glad you finally got help. I hope you continue to do well my friend and hit me up from time to time.This won't be like my other letters to you. There won't be any outpours of love, only a collection of facts and thoughts. The mystical power of the point of view that will differ from yours. But I know you won't stop, you won't care, you won't listen. You never do, after all. So and unsent letter it will be. After all, you're furious and I just don't care enough anymore to do anything else.

When you first barged into my life I didn't want you around. The only reasons I responded were boredom and fascination with your intellect. I wasn't looking for love or any kind of relationship, that just happened. You said *I love you* first. I hesitated. Love? After two days? Ridiculous. But I couldn't overlook the connection we had. The coincidences that seemed hellbent on bringing us together. And then it happened. Your first meltdown over something small. It was a major red flag that I ignored. I was a fool. And I was too lonely to want to notice the truth. It only continued, as weeks went on, you would leave me and come back apologising. A weekly ritual. It was a major drain on my sanity, and you knew full well what my mental state was before. So one day, after you came back and still couldn't accept that I had a life before you, I said something irresponsibly stupid. I think that subconsciously I just wanted this whole thing to end. But my conscious mind had different plans.

A few days later I reached out to you, missing you, still in love with you. You couldn't forgive me. Still, for the sake of my deteriorating mental state, you agreed to friendship. We spent hours talking. You said you were going on a trip and that there was a man who had feelings for you, with whom you planned to move on with. **That was devastating**, but I held back my feelings wanting to merely be a friend and, with time, move on myself. I helped you calm down when you started panicking about a health issue and you even thanked me for caring so much that I spent hours calming you down. Then I made a joke. Fitting one for a friend to make, terrible for a boyfriend to make. Had you not dumped me days prior I wouldn't have said that. You got mad, said that I didn't care about you and left.

You came back, as you always did, with apologies in tow and I stupidly let you back in. But there's always something. There's always pain you bring with you. As I was showing you something, you spotted that I was browsing a certain subreddit. You knew what mental state you left me in, you knew that I was all alone with it and you, yourself suggested that I seek out companionship. Despite it being **before** you came back, despite **knowing and confirming** yourself that I **didn't act on it** and knowing full well that all I needed was someone to talk with. But you thought that I'm a cheater anyway. I could've done it, but I didn't. But that doesn't mean anything you. Just like the fact that you've pushed me further and further away with each argument we had. Yet, I remained loyal, I have a clean conscience. **You went on a week-long trip with another guy** after being rather clear what you think of me and what you plan on doing with him. **Yet I remained loyal.** But I am the bad guy. Because I **considered** talking with someone **about you** after you ripped my heart to shreds.

You made me into a monster in your head. You tried to hurt me with vicious words but that mostly failed. You can't use the same arguments I used against myself to make me feel bad. When someone already sees themselves as ugly and stupid you repeating it won't change much. Everything else you've mentioned was things that you wanted, not me. Living in a huge city, when I run from one for some peace and quiet, wasn't as enticing as you think. **You were the only reason I even entertained the idea.** Going back to college? I considered that a waste of time with my lengthy résumé, but **I'd do it for you**. The only thing you were right about was me being always online, seemingly having no life. Only you forgot that you met me during a global pandemic and I live in a place where the situation is getting worse daily. Am I supposed to party every day? Preposterous. Safe to say, all you provided me with was a boring rant.

Now you're publically calling me a psychopath and kink-shaming me. Just about the only thing that could annoy me, but ultimately harmless. Most people have some kinks, even you, but I'm mature enough to stay quiet on the matter. You see, I never opened up to you, not really. I had my insecurities used against me once before, so my trust in women isn't what it used to be. I'm sorry about that *(not really)*. I'm also sorry about the fact that you allowed yourself to be manipulated by a boy who made multiple accounts to follow you, the same man who called your phone from a new number each time you blocked him, the same person who lied to you about me before. Yes, and you call me a psychopath while letting one whisper bullshit into your ear.

I never lied to you and I never would've. I never wanted anything but happiness for you. I truly cared for you. I loved you. Even after you revealed that you were still married weeks into our relationship. I loved you. Now, however, I see what you are. I pity you. You call me a small man, but even I wouldn't try to publically humiliate someone like you're trying to humiliate me. I trusted you and even if you felt that your trust has been abused, to make a public performance of it is simply immature and pathetic. Especially since you yourself said that internet relationships aren't real in our last conversation, so what's the point again?

I'm not ever heartbroken, since you broke my heart some time ago and it didn't have the time to heal. This was just dull pain. I hope you'll get some satisfaction from this. Just remember, no turning back this time. There's nothing waiting for you here anymore.Hey

Despite us starting to speak again after so many years, there are things that will forever be left unsaid

When I met you, I took you for granted, thought you would be there no matter how shitty my attitude towards you could be at times

I ignored your goals without realizing it, at the time everything took me by storm and it all was thrown against you

It was the moment I realized this that I left you...
I left you because I realized that I was the reason you were suffering
I left you because I was in the way of all you wanted to do
You never did anything to me except make me happy, you gifted me with some of the only memories where I remember being happy

I should have listened to you, I shouldn’t have listened to anyone else, but I did and things turned out for the worst

These thoughts have plagued my mind every single day for the last years

But they will forever be left unsaid, unheard

So this is it.. my silent apology to you
And you will never even have to hear itJ,

I knew the accident was going to happen an hour before it did. I noticed you drifting on the road, but I said nothing. I saw you do this, yet still asked you if you minded if I napped for a bit. I woke up to us rolling into the ditch. I looked over at you and thought you were dead. I couldn’t even see you with all the air bags around you. I was so relieved when you told me you weren’t hurt. It was only then I realized just how broken my arm was. We had to wait half an hour for an ambulance and it took another hour to reach a hospital. The ambulance drivers gave me two Tylenol for a break where the bone was poking through my skin. 

The country hospital did it’s best to fix me. We laughed and joked around at our luck. I didn’t think the accident was that bad. It was only when I saw the photos later did I get it. We stayed close. 

After the doctors back home rebroke my arm a month later, you stopped talking to me.  You don’t even acknowledge I exist when we are in the same room. I’m not expecting grand gestures, but eye contact and a hello would be nice. 

It’s been 7 months. I’m still disabled and can’t work full time. The doctors are talking about rebreaking my bone again. I’m still dealing with the consequences of your actions on a daily basis. I’m not being told when I’ll be better anymore. 

I just want an apology. I just want to know how you managed to flip a car on a beautiful summer afternoon with no hazards around. I just want my friend back.I guess this is goodbye I never thought that I would have to say this but I truly have to say it because I feel like I messed up big-time I don't know how else to fix all of this I wish I knew but I don't and I miss you I miss everybody I miss everything I wish everything could go back to the way it was but I know I messed everything up and I know it'll never be the same as it was it ever again and I wish I never did the things that I did but I just hope that all everybody can accept my apology even you I just hope that everything can be okay again eventually in the future and then maybe I can be front we can all be friends again but I don't know if that's not what you guys want but that's what I want and I hope that everything goes okay and I hope that you guys are okay.That's assuming that I was wrong. That my abandonment issues were over reacting, that you could be frustrated with me without falling out of love..without hating me. You told me to stay,that relationships have issues that we could work through them. I heard you but I couldn't believe it. Not after what you had said about me behind my back, how could you possibly want someone like that to stay? Even knowing it's fucked up and wrong,growing up love was conditional and they kept score. Every mistake, every annoyance was a reason to hate me. I guess I'm still hard wired to believe that even if it's not how i love others. In my mind at the time,and still a bit now, the fact i had annoyed you,upset you, that's unforgivable,you probably hate me,and even if you dont you deserve better than me. Ridiculous and dramatic? probably but thats how love always worked in my family and other relationships. I'm not an awful person I dont fully hate myself but I never felt good enough for you. You were smart,funny, strong and intimidating,yet still if you payed attention the big tough facade covered someone so protective and loving. You could see it with your family,your friends,and I think with me. I was always happy having you around,even on the days that my moodiness fucked me over. Your laugh, your hand in mine... I don't know how to discribe it. Love I guess. But still I ran,you were calmly trying to reason with me still I ran off crying. I wish I had listened. I wish I had told you right off the bat I saw screenshots. I wish I had gone to you first. I wish i hadn't of let my moodiness get the best of me. Mostly now i wish there was still hope for us. I'm terrified of reaching out,I have no clue how you view me anymore. I just know no matter how much i try to force myself to not,I'm still in love with you, and I miss you terribly.

anyways.. I hope you're doing well.Suck up your pride, move through the fear, and apologize? 

I don’t forgive you but I do appreciate you showing me what I don’t deserve. It’s too late, by the way.You messaged me again updating me briefly about your life. You have so much control that such small updates, these brief 9 lines of text can soothe my heartache and the anxiety of separation. I can see you want to make conversation and with ease, you get over things like you always do. But that’s not the case for me. I left you on read because I do not know how to tread this anymore, even if done carefully, I know the pain will magnify and engulf me once more.

You have a way of coming back, not exceeding a week of no contact but yet still breadcrumbs, weak efforts as if I’m a low hanging fruit. It’s not enough for me and yet I hate how I still want to engage and re-enter this vicious cycle with you once more. To be entrenched in this painful cycle and compromise my self-worth. I need to stop.Call me... 

Right now.. 

Listen to me enjoy my new toy as you confess your love and offer your apologizes

A girl can dream I guessHey I know this is unsolicited but, I just feel embarrassed for how I texted you asking for closure a few years back. I still think about it from time to time and I just wanted to apologize for being weird. I had a really hard go of it for a while and I was quite irrational. I’m not asking for attention, sympathy, or even a response. I just really needed to finally get that off my chest and address it or else I would continue to obsess over it. I just never felt right about it after and I’ve lived with this guilt for a while. I do really hope you’re doing well and have continued success in your relationship and life!You deserve so much better. 

You deserve to be someone's first choice, you don't need to settle for someone who is just using you.

You deserve respect, you don't need to put up with people abusing you.

You deserve to ask for help, you don't need to apologize for having a hard time.

You deserve to be happy.




[Edit] I knew this might be relatable to a few people but I didn't expect it to have this kind of response. I'm so glad people have appreciated it and found it helpful, it almost makes up for the fact I can't say this to the person I wrote it for.Dear mom and dad,

I'm sorry I'm not the daughter you wanted to have. I'm sorry I'm a disappointment. I'm sorry you cant find a reason to be proud of me. I'm sorry that I'm messy and expensive and dramatic and bratty and mean and a bore and a pain and everything else. I'm sorry that I lie. I'm sorry that I'm so insecure. I'm sorry that I've tried on selves to try and find one that fits only to give up and become a cardboard cutout once more. I'm sorry that I keep getting hurt and never learn from my mistakes. I'm sorry that I make so many mistakes all the time.

I'm sorry.Funny, saying hurtful things in the heat of the moment is okay, at least forgivable, but someone throwing their hands up when the shit becomes too much to bear is unjustifiably inexcusable? If your person broke up with you in the heat of the moment and yet STILL reached out to apologize, *especially knowing your words* ***caused*** *it*, holding it over their head like you're only respecting their decision is fucking stupid.I am sorry.  I understand there is nothing else I can do.  But I am sorry for my behaviors and working real hard to change for the better.  I am sorry for being mean and saying awful words to you.  I hope we can move on from this one day. I know I plan to. This apology is from the heart. You know it is.  It is what it is is what I say. Sorry for not humbling myself more.  I am sure I disappointed you. As I did to others. 

Have a good day. I still love you.Some days I find myself ashamed and sad and wanting to get down on my knees, apologize profusely, and beg forgiveness.  Some days I find the thought of you fills me with anger and hatred and self-righteous indignation. Occasionally, I remember the good things and smile. My feelings about you vary a lot. But, my feelings about me rarely change. Every day, I feel small, insecure, and worthless. Sometimes, it’s just a small part of me. Sometimes it consumes me. But, it is always there. I didn’t used to feel this way. It arose out of what happened with you. I can’t figure out how to get rid of it and reclaim the self-confident person I used to be. 

It probably involves finding a way to accept and make peace with what happened with you. I know I have not done enough to do that. I’ve clung to the conflict, to the questions, to the mystery.  For that, I am sorry.  I’ve tried to figure out why I am so reluctant to let go. I think it is because doing so would, in a way, normalize our interactions and the decisions you made (and I refer to the decisions *you* made because there was a power imbalance that gave you all of the power and you freely exercised it).  I think I am afraid to live in a world where this past we have, this story we created, is real—where things like this happen and are accepted, where trying to make peace is seen as a hostile move, where a complete breakdown of communication is preferred, and where hostility, threats, and on-going nastiness are the order of the day. 

I can’t live in a world like that. I don’t fit there. I’m a snowflake. I’m sensitive. I care about people. I care about maintaining peace and communicating about feelings (when necessary) and working through differences. When you lash out at me, I feel hurt. When you threaten me, I feel fear. When you silence me, I feel helpless and powerless. I am an empathetic, feeling person. I feel deeply, even when I say little. No amount of therapy or medication is going to beat that out of me. I can build some armor from the scars so I don’t show the feelings but the feelings will still be there underneath the thick leather. And the world you showed me is not kind to snowflakes. 

But, let me ask you this. I know you think I’m a monster because I am a snowflake. But, are snowflakes really that bad? Winter can be intense and there is no avoiding feeling its temperatures (they definitely wake you up on a cold morning) but it is also really beautiful. And, on a cold clear day, when you shine light on the snowflakes, they sparkle and shimmer in the most magical and soul-nurturing way. Maybe if you approach me and other snowflakes like me with light and clarity instead of suspicion, judgment, and darkness, you will see that being a snowflake means we can sparkle and shimmer and remind your soul that there is beauty and light in this world.  You just need to open your eyes and your mind to the possibility that we, too, can bring value to the world. There are no monsters here, only people whose potential you have failed to see. I hope someday you can understand that. I hope someday you accept the snowflakes. There are a lot of us and by cutting us down and throwing us away, you are missing out.You're still unaccountable. Thank you for setting me free, the energy you have for me is debilitating. You didn't leave nothing to show for your love--the way you treated me taught me exactly what to avoid. I'm not going to thank you for that because you could've taught me the same lesson with love. Forgive yourself, you're the one who fucked this up for yourself and you're the one who is gonna live with the regret.Even though you mentally abused me for so long, I still can't get over you. I know we aren't meant to be together but why do I find myself hoping you will call me or show up to my place and apologize for all the shit you put me through? It doesn't make sense. It's been 2 months and I still think about you everyday. I can't wait for the day you don't run through my thoughts at all.I'd say this to a few people if I could, and hope that I could look into their eyes when I did. And that they could peer back into mine, which are looking much less flat, empty and hollow as of late. There's a hint of that old glint - but a poet I'm not, nor much of a writer. So I'll get on with it, and say it you.

I can't take back my actions or my words. I've always been a proponent of owning ones' mistakes, and I'm owning mine. All I can do is learn as I go, change, and grow. If I've offended you, and you wish to hurt or offend me, I can understand that. I won't ask you to stop, I will ask for no quarter, and expect none to be given. I'm not a saint by any means, and I'm realistic. Sometimes even pragmatic. I'm human, of course if you were to lay off, it would be better for me, and couldn't hurt any of that change or growth I speak of, but what you do is what you do. Out of my hands, and into yours. All I can do is better myself.

To that end, if you, or any of the other folks I'd say this to if we could sit down and look each other in the eye, and speak from the heart - well, I wouldn't ask anything of you. Not at this point, certainly. But perhaps if you would stand in the way of that change or growth, at some point you'll consider your own motivations, maybe even question them. It happens to almost everyone at some time or other. I know for a long time I almost actively avoided mirrors, vertical ones anyway. Because I abhorred what I saw staring back at me, and couldn't even recognize it anymore. Surely you know I don't mean in the physical sense, of course, but that was in there as well. I'm lucky in my ways. For a person who has put their body through the amount of abuse I have for the number of years, I still look pretty decent externally. Now internally, well, we'll find out soon enough, but that can't be as good, and I'll take that as it comes. My decisions have been my own. But back to your decisions, I hope that when you look into that mirror, you're good with what you see, and think you will remain that way. If not, perhaps some of our shared experiences will foster some growth and change in you, too. 

I realize I have been and can be an asshole. I also know that goes for you as well, and that's cool. I realize that people have been affected by the global pandemic also, just like me, and that it has changed life as we know it. Many found themselves more bored, seeking new sources of entertainment as such. Many felt or were, perhaps are, more isolated and alone than ever before. I know for me personally, the past few months redefined the word alone. If you or anyone else feels any part of the above, you have my sympathy, and empathy. I also know that particularly in the USA, we are in a tumultuous time politically amidst growing civil unrest. Many are rightfully concerned about their future, some are very afraid, and some are very angry at the powers that be or have been for allowing things to sink to the level that they have. I feel the same. Many also are angry and fighting back in the ways they can or lashing out at those that they feel side with or keep those powers in place. I have done my share of that in the past, and my heart is there, too. Although personally I feel that unless all people who are not rich and powerful, mostly born that way, stop bickering amongst ourselves - which only furthers their cause - we are doomed to continue being pushed down and marginalized. Racially, politically, fucking sports teams if you take it that seriously - without finding common ground and extending a hand over the fence, we are divided and easily conquered. I can almost hear Bob Mould. 

You're smart. Yep, you. And I'm teetering on rambling, as I am wont to do. You know what I'm getting at, so I'll shut up. For a minute. ;) If you wanted to hurt me, mission accomplished. If you wanted to kill me, well, you're not the first, and sorry, but I'm not done living just yet. What do I really have, ten years before that massive heart attack drops me, if I'm lucky? Heart disease is on both sides of my family, and none of them have gotten down like I do. A little patience is a virtue. I DID pick up smoking again, for now, and for sure the past few months and my experiences have hastened my death - so, well played. If you suspect that my motives are a ruse, that I'm playing the possum, fair enough, and I deserve that. But you're incorrect. If you, or any others, actually ever had my best interest at heart, well, that's hard for me to believe, especially now, but if I'm incorrect too - thanks. Sorry if I fucked that up if it were that way at one point, and changed. I'm trying, truly, and succeeding, slowly but surely. I expect no reprieve, nor will I ask for one. I do offer apologies and forgiveness, and again, my story won't change. If you took the time to read all this, thanks you, whether it makes a bit of difference or not.I want you to know that I’m thinking about you and hoping you are okay during this tumultuous time. 2020 has been a hard year for everyone and I imagine you have felt its effects, too. I think 2020 has been particularly confusing for rule-followers because the rules have been so unclear and constantly changing.  We just want clarity about what we are supposed to be doing and for how long. 

I suspect that, like me you are a rule-follower. You always struck me as kind of vanilla—not in an NSFW way (I have no idea what you are like in the bedroom and I don’t care to speculate) but more in an understanding of, and approach to, life kind of way. It was like you were so used to policing yourself and maintaining a squeaky clean, polite facade that even straying into the most subtle kind of dirty joke or rude language felt a little dangerous (even though every one else does it all the time and much worse). I’m the same way. My language and jokes are so clean that no one really expects me to understand and appreciate the dirty ones (even though I definitely do) and everyone is shocked when I occasionally swear or laugh at what other people say. I just project this image of someone who doesn’t cross that line or only hints at it. But subtly stepping a toe over that line can be fun. 

What makes you a rule-follower? For me, it comes out of a desire for efficiency (following the rules makes things go faster), a little bit of inexperience and naïveté, and a fear of getting called out or yelled at. I have memories of being yelled at or spoken to sternly by adults who weren’t my parents when I was very young and feeling so scared and distressed and embarrassed by it. I guess I started policing my behavior very early on to avoid those experiences. 

Now, when I get into situations where someone might yell at me (especially in my personal life), I either start apologizing and giving in to whatever they want, go completely silent, or try to find a way to escape. 

Is that why you’ve never talked to me directly about any of this? Are you afraid I will yell at you or make it awkward? Or perhaps it isn’t me you fear. Perhaps it is your family? Will you get in trouble if you talk to me? 

One thing I’ve discovered as I’ve struggled through the last few years is, sometimes you have to take the risk of being yelled at. If you don’t, the problems keep festering and growing. Also, some yellers will just keep using your tendency to give in to take advantage and take whatever they want from you. The more you give in, the more they take until they’ve crowded you out of your own decisions, roles, and life. That doesn’t end well for anyone. It’s better to stand up for yourself and push back, especially if you are an equal to the yeller . (Obviously, if it’s your boss,though, they get to overrule you but at least you know they’ve heard and considered your points). 

I hope you know I would never yell at you. I am not a yeller.  Even during uncomfortable conversations, I keep quiet (though I might get nervous or shaky). I also hope you consider talking to me one day. We have so many misunderstandings that need clarification. Also, I’m a pretty great person and you are really missing out by not knowing me ;-).  

And, some day I might have the courage to risk you yelling at me. I might push back on this and plead my case. I’m tired of being meek and this means a lot to me. But, I promise it won’t happen anytime soon. I don’t want to stress you out (and I haven’t the slightest idea how I would even do it). Also, it would be better for everyone if you come to me of your own accord to initiate the conversation. I hope you do someday. 

Until then, I hope you stay well and that things haven’t got you too down. Despite everything,I still worry about your well-being sometimes. I hope you are okay. Take care.Hey beautiful, I have no way of knowing what the future holds anymore than you do.  I've spent the last few years feeling everything from complete devastation and pain, to feeling like everything will work out exactly the way that it is supposed to, for both of us.  I would be lying if I said that I am not hoping for our paths to come back together, but fully understand that if they do not, that I will be ok, and so will you!  I have told you the way that I feel more times than I can count, and that is just being honest.  However, it makes my heart feel good when I let these feelings out, and believe that if they are for you, then you are the one that deserves to hear them.  Maybe they help you in some way?  Maybe they don't.  I know that I once suggested that perhaps I had you on a pedastal, and personally know how sometimes this is overwhelming, and sometimes even can come across as needy.  Looking back I probably did have you on a pedastal, and am sorry for putting that on you.  I'm actually sorry for a lot of things, and hope that someday I can apologize for those things.  The truth is that neither one of us was prepared for what we experienced that night our paths crossed for the first time.  I suppose I can only speak for myself, but I honestly was not looking for you at that time.  I wasn't looking for anyone if the truth were told, at least not consciously.  I knew the very second our eyes met however, that you would change my life in ways I could have never imagined.  I was aware that I wasn't happy with my life, grateful? Absolutely!  I was very aware that I had been blessed with more than most, at least in terms of safety, health, and basic human necessities.  I was also aware however that something was missing from my life.  The love and affection that you showed me was unlike anything that I had ever before felt, to this day it is difficult for me to put the way I felt into words, the closest words to describe it is pure joy.  Since you left I have yet to feel this feeling again.  I was in disbelief when you told me that you didnt feel the same way, your voice sounded different as you told me this, your eyes displaying what appeared to me as sadness, almost regret.  I am truly sorry for the way that I reacted.  My heart had never before felt so much pain, my soul felt as if it was torn from my chest.  I cursed the universe, begging to know why, desperately needing to know why we met when we did.  That is something I would still love to know.  I believe fully that someday I will, even if it isnt what I want to hear.  You told me that I had hurt you, that I hurt you very badly, which didnt make sense with you denying you felt anything for me, irregardless making me feel awful as hurting you was the very last thing I ever wanted.  One of the important reasons for these words for you is to hopefully figure out why you told me things that didnt make any sense, or at least didnt coincide with the way that you said you felt, as well as why the things you said without words just didnt add up.  The main reason however is to hopefully figure out why I still feel as strongly for you all this time as the night we met, as every time we spent together.  I need to know why I feel so certain that our story isnt over?  Why more and more that I can feel you so close?  Do you think about the time we shared?  The memories we made?    There has to be more to us!  I simply dont see how I could continue to feel the way that I do for you.  I really need you to know who I really am. I want to know who you really are.  Are you the person I spent the most wonderful times of my life with?  The sweet, affectionate, caring person?, or the person who claimed to feel nothing at all?  I cant believe anything other than the previous, at least not until I know for certain.  I don't think either one of us did anything wrong, we simply crossed paths at the wrong time.  I need you to know that my promise to you has never changed, that my door will always be open for you, and can only hope and believe that if you ever feel like it was a mistake to walk away, that you will reach out to me.  I think if you knew who I really am, that you would have already done so by now.  To finish I want to state that I understand that I could be wrong, that maybe you did feel the way you said you did.  I only hope you can see why I would question your words, as I hope that you can see what you said by saying nothing at all, that what I seen in your eyes was extremely real, and that you truly did feel the same thing that I felt.  Honestly, it would probably be much easier to do nothing at all, for me to accept what is, and move on.  I simply believe the connection I felt with you isnt one that comes around very often if at all for most.  And I cant move forward until I have given it my all.  Having said this, I will continue to respect the words that you last told me, and only hope that you will follow your heart, and that I am not making a huge mistake by following mine.  I'll never forget you, or the beautiful memories we created, and can only hope that we will have a lifetime someday to create many, many more.  I hope that your life is going well, that you are safe in this crazy world.  
Sincerely Yours Forever, 
Чоловік, якому ти одного разу сказав: "Це так приємно знати, що такі хлопці, як ти, насправді існують"So, I’m sorry. 

As I’ve come to find out, I doubt I’m the setteling down type. I don’t think I’ll be like this forever, but when I was younger I was stupid. I had every intention of loving you, and I did, but I’ve come to realize that what I was looking for wasn’t what I thought it was, or what I lead you to believe. 

I’ve taken a few years off from dating. I was in a friends with benefits sort of thing for awhile but we just kinda drifted apart and never had any hard feelings. During this time I’ve learned a lot. I’ve had a lot of time to improve, and I’ve had a lot of time to think. The conclusions I’ve come up with is that I don’t get lonely when I don’t have somebody, I actually love it. 

I regret having you fall in love with me, for me to not care afterwords.  I know that pain, and I’m sorry I caused it. 

I try to not regret much that happens in my life, and for the most part I succeed, but I am sorry that I hurt you. 

I think if you could see me now, you would be proud. I’ve done good things, and I continue to find more positive ways to fill my life. I believe that we could be good friends, but that’s just it, I don’t know if I’m supposed to find somebody, or if I’m supposed to continue on as I am, but either way I feel guilty for having jumped headfirst in something I didn’t have a heart for because it was exciting, because it sure was exciting. We had great times, we had terrible times. 

I know you’re doing well, and I’m happy about that. You’ve got somebody who cares about you, and I can’t tell you how glad I am about that. I wish you the best in life, and many happy memories.
